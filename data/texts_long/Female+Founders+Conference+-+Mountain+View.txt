Hello, everybody. Let's make a start. Thank you. Shhh. Can she come up here? I want to get their attention. I could sing some opera. No, we're fine. Don't worry. We're having microphone issues. Okay. Thank you. All right. Hello, everybody. My name is Kirsteen Nathoo. I'm one of the partners here at Y Combinator. And I'm really excited to welcome all of you, all 350 of you, here to our offices in Mountain View. We've now been running the Female Founders Conference for five years, and in that time we've had the pleasure of talking to over 4,000 amazing women who've come to listen to speakers and to meet each other. We've seen women like today's speaker, Alexandra Zatarain from Eight, go from sitting in the audience like you to actually being one of the speakers today and we funded companies formed by founders who've met at the female founders conference so we hope that's the case for many of you here today as well today you'll get to meet YC alumni and partners but most importantly take this time to meet the women around you, make connections with them. So, first of all, a few questions to help get to know each other. How many of you have already started your own companies? Oh wow, amazing! Yeah. How many of you are software engineers's, I guess. Okay, great. So I just want now to have you take a few minutes to introduce yourselves to a few people sitting around you who you don't already know. Just to start making those conversations happen. Over to you. I'll give you a few minutes. soon Thank you. Vamos para a grão. Thank you. All right. Okay. Okay. So. Okay, so. Okay, everybody, I don't think I'm ever going to be able to stop you talking now. All right, so. Okay, let's keep going. All right, so now that you all know each other. Okay, quiet everybody. Too many connections now. All right, now that you all know each other, I'd like to introduce our first speaker. Okay, I would like to welcome our first speaker, Phaedra Ellis-Lampkins, who is the founder and CEO of Promise. who is the founder and CEO of Promise. Now Promise went through the winter 2018 batch of YC and is working on a solution to reduce the jail population. Prior to founding Promise, Phaedra ran revenue and operations at Honor, a company that offers in-home care to senior citizens. And before Honor, Phaedra worked with the musician Prince. She's a labor and community organizer by trade who's committed to making measurable change in the world. So, welcome Phaedra. Hello. Can you hear me in the back? Okay, great. First, how exciting is it to be in a room full of phenomenal women who have started companies or are starting companies? I just feel like I want to walk around and just like rub everyone and say, oh, it's so exciting. Just the energy in the air. My name is Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins and I am the co-founder and CEO of a company called Promise and just incredibly thrilled to be here today. So I thought I would start out and talk a little bit about myself and why we ended up starting a company. So this is my mom, Gail Amkins. And my mom, when I was growing up, was a waitress. And so we grew up pretty poor. My mom worked at Dave's Restaurant in San Francisco. If you've ever had a great burger, you've probably been there. And growing up as the mom, you have a mom who's a waitress, you really rely on tips. And so there was a very kind of physical feeling. Like, you know you're broke when you're a kid as you get older. And I knew things like when I went shopping and my mom used food stamps, people treated us differently. I knew that we ate. I remember the first time I saw people eating meat and sandwiches and I was like, wait, you don't eat cheese and pickle sandwiches? And it wasn't until I was older that I realized, oh, that's because we didn't have meat money, as we called it. And so I spent a lot of time just really understanding kind of what happens, I think, when you're just broke. And then something changed, which is when I was 12 years old, my mom went back to school, and she got a degree, and she got a job with a county. And I just, you know, you have moments that you remember as a child. And I remember the moment she got the call, and it was like $10 an hour. And I remember my mom saying, what are we going to do with all that money? And I just knew, like like our life had shifted. And the thing that became very clear to me is that when you have a little bit more money, as I think about, I went from free lunch to reduced lunch at school, which meant I was in a different line. You just feel differently. People treated us differently. My mom carried herself differently. And so what I knew was that there was this feeling and what was transformative for me. So as I grew older, I just said, I want that for all kids. I want all kids to feel like no shame when they go to the grocery store, not different because they have free lunch or they get free peanut butter, but really, how do we create a feeling for all kids where they get to feel equal and they get to feel proud. So that was really what I set out to do. So I spent the first kind of 15 years of my professional life working in the labor movement, working with janitors on behalf of janitors, teamsters, teachers, and really trying to understand how did we create opportunity for working families and how did we create dignity in work? And then I started to run a labor federation in Silicon Valley. And all of a sudden, the way that people went to work changed. It used to be that people had one employer, they stayed at a company for a long time, but increasingly work began to be contracted out. And what was most striking to me is that some of those jobs got worse, not better. So we would see these like covers of like these people who were like a receptionist at Google and all of a sudden they had a Ferrari on the cover of Newsweek. But in my world I represented janitors who are working two jobs, living in Stockton, driving in and kind of cleaning the waste packets, base packets of some of these folks. So the, in fact, technology had not yet transformed the lives of a lot of working people that I knew. So I was really in this moment, I spent a lot of time doing that, and then I just, all of a sudden, this man Barack Obama ran for president. And as a woman of color, I was like, I cannot be in that moment. And so I went to go do some stuff to really think about how his economy grew, how did working people actually get opportunity. And while doing that, I met Diana Frappier. So Diana is my co-founder. You might think because I've started a company, I'd have some really thoughtful photos. Instead, I have a photo from her 40th birthday. Because, frankly, why not? So this is us in the office. And when I met Diana, she was very different than myself. And the reason was, I grew up poor, my dad was violent, so I thought all people that committed crimes were horrific, right? You go to jail, good. You are in neighborhoods where we had drug dealings, good. Go to jail. And then I met Diana, and Diana was a criminal defense lawyer by trade. And we'd be walking down the street in Oakland, and I'd kind of be a little bit like, okay. And then some dude would come running up to us and be like, die, die. And I'd be like, hey, okay. And I'd be like, hey, okay, and I'd say like, who's that? And she'd be like, oh, yeah, I represented him. He's a pimp. And I'd say like, oh, okay, but he's a good pimp, Phaedra. And I'd say, oh, okay, cool, cool, let's just keep going. And then we'd be walking down the street more, hey, and I, oh, who's that? Oh, murder conviction. cool cool this is this is great uh we had lots of things we would see folks we once went somewhere and uh i saw someone i was like oh my gosh that poor woman she's probably abused and i had this whole dialogue in my head but what i learned really being with diana for a decent amount of time is that i had always thought of people as the crimes they committed not the humans that had become in an experience that led up to that and when i learned with committed, not the humans that had become an experience that led up to that. And what I learned with Diana watching the people that she represented is that many people had grown up just like me but hadn't had the opportunities that I had had. I had been lucky. I had a mom who looked out for me. I had done an internship that got me in the labor movement. But there were a lot of folks who didn't have those opportunities. I began to realize that in fact foster youth were the population most likely to end up incarcerated, that when we looked at these things, that in fact people had had these incredibly challenging lives without a lot of opportunity and had ended up in some awful situations. So Diana and I worked together at Green For All, and then we met through a friend named Van Jones who if you ever watch CNN you can see him on TV shout out to Van and Van then introduced me to the musician Prince I was pregnant and so I was like I'm on maternity leave and Van does like all good friends do and say I'm sure you have too much time on your hands while you're pregnant. So come meet Prince. And I go to meet Prince and I have to say, as a kid, I hadn't been a fan because I'd watched that movie Purple Rain and he hit a woman in it, right? And so when you watch those movies as a kid and because my dad was violent, I was like, like, I just like, oh, I'm just not just not you know like he hit a woman it's like you know not my people and then I met him and he quickly became my people and the first thing that we did is we worked on getting his master's back and I knew nothing about music and we got his master's back relatively quickly and the way we got his master's back is because I didn't mind asking questions that everyone else thought was stupid. So I started out and I said, okay, well, why can't you have your masters? Okay, well, because there's, they own it, they don't want to give it to them, they already gave me cash. Cool. Okay. Well, then I asked questions and I learned that there was two sides of folks who own music. There was one side, which the record company owns, which is 50%, and there's one side that the publisher or the writer owns. And so I was like, wait, we own that? Yeah, okay, cool. So let's just not let them make any money with it. And what we discovered is, by asking stupid questions, we just stopped, we said, you just can't make money off of it. We're going to stop it because he owns all of the publishing because he's written every song and he owns part of the recordings. And we settled in 90 days. And so he'd been in this 30 year battle and we got his masters back in 90 days. And then I had a baby and I was like, okay, cool, going back to social change. And he was like no no that's not how this works you're staying with me and so I spent the next two years really working with him with Diana and I working with him and it was incredibly important because we learned a couple things one is I never met a human who sacrificed everything for his belief in truth, for his belief in stewardship of his own resources. And he made me bold in a way that no one ever had before. Because there's something unique when you know that someone believes you. Like in his world, we created magic. So that meant we were magical. So he was just like, I remember someone was like, Fade, you're so mean. I don't want to come there if she's there. And he was like, Fade, you're so mean. I don't wanna come there if she's there. And he was like, well then you can't come here. And I just had never had just that type of commitment and that sense of just justice and just like we were a team. And so we spent two and a half more years together and I learned something really important, which is I watched how technology was changing the way that artists of color especially were being paid. What happened is artists used to own their music, then they would make money off radio, but increasingly what was happening is technology was devaluing the cost of music and what they would actually make, and in essence it was decreasing, because what would happen is like Spotify was also owned part and part by a record label. That record label then determined who got paid what. So what we decided is to do this deal called Tidal. And Tidal was really about artists owning their own music. But what I learned most importantly is technology wasn't working out great for the folks in the labor movement and for working people. It wasn't working out great for the folks in the labor movement and for working people it wasn't working out great for artists of color and so I became really interested in how do you make technology work well for working people and people who own their own stuff I just love seeing him and so then I went to work at a company called honor and the reason I went there is because I couldn't afford business school, let me be clear. It's funny. It's like if you are in technology, it's the first place I hear people talk about where people went to college when they're adults. I never heard that before. When I get in tech, people are like, oh, HBS, Stanford Business School. Yeah, that person went here. And I was like, oh oh my gosh like aren't we 30 or 40 years old got it check okay clearly this world works different than any place I've been in before I have a girlfriend who's at Apple we were like are they talking about like college football she's like no that's how they talk about themselves oh god it's like that's how they talk about themselves okay cool okay check see son that's right they talk about themselves. Okay, cool. Okay, check. CSUN, that's right, Cal State Northridge, for all of you that don't know. So I went to work at Honor. And Honor was a company funded by Marc Andreessen. He put $15 of the $20 million in for seed funding. I went in to run operations. And it was funny because when I went there, people were like, oh, she's a labor organizer. I'm sure she's just gonna organize all the workers and screw your company. And I think the team had faith and I started there. We started running operations. Amazing technology company. I love, love them. Just amazing. And then I noticed the sales team wasn't producing quickly enough. So I was like, look let's just go do sales. So we started to do sales. And then the operations team was generating more sales than the sales team. And so I then became the head of sales and operations. So I ran revenue and operations at Honor. This is us setting up a store at Walmart in Texas here in the south. We were in San Francisco in the East Bay, but this is it. But what I learned at Honor was really important. First, I learned as a woman of color, I did not know how to communicate in a way that people who'd worked at McKenzie and went to Stanford Business School did. And more importantly, I learned that I felt like an idiot because of it. And so, and I watched a lot of people of color and women and working people be in that environment and just say, like I was like, okay, I remember one day we were talking about churn. And I was like, yeah, churn is when people leave. And they were like, no, churn is not when people leave, it's when people leave for negative reasons. And I was like, okay, negative reasons. And I think it was one of those experiences where I was like, I'm so smart in my regular life but I don't feel like I have the tools and resources even as a high-performing exec to communicate in a way that's consistent with my value so I was like okay I want to learn that and it was clear to me because we'd have these conversations and we'd be talking about stuff and I would know I knew what I knew and the reason I raised that because as I thought about going I would know I knew what I knew. And the reason I raised that, because as I thought about going to raise money, I knew it was a problem I had to solve for. The second thing that I learned at Honor was that people who were working in tech were desperate to feel connected and committed to a purpose greater than the technology they were building. That I thought originally, like when I'd been in the labor movement and when I had been in music, I was like, oh, it's these like 18-year-olds who don't care what they're doing, who don't care about anything. And then what I realized is there was a lot of really good humans who were trying to make the world better and were just trying to figure out how to do it well. The last thing I learned is I was as smart as anyone who built a company and that I had only thought before about kind of working somewhere because I'd never grown up in a world where people said start a company. I grew up in a world where people said don't leave the job with benefits, right? Like when I left my first job that was a union job, my mom and my grandmother were like, I don't know what's gonna happen to you. Will they take you back? Do you like them? And I don't know, when I left Prince, my mom was like, oh my gosh, like this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. You're going to work for some random company that started two years ago. What is this? And so I thought it was really, really important. And then Prince died. And when Prince died, I was his power of attorney and the officer for his corporations because when people love you, they don't let you go. And something really shifted in me when he died. And I spent some time in Minneapolis where he lived and there were things that really struck me. One is I knew I couldn't go back to just making money again, right? Like when you lose someone you love deeply, it impacts you. And I knew that I wanted to feel good in a way that I didn't feel naturally because I just felt sad. And so I was like, I gotta figure out how to do right in the world again. The second thing that happened, which was incredibly empowering, is people got mad at me. Like random people who didn't know me were like, oh, you got fired by Prince, something must have happened. And I was like, of course I didn't get fired. I've never been fired in my life. But being in a very public environment, having reporters come to honor, made me realize that I'd kind of always not been my fullest self, right? As soon as people started attacking me who didn't know me, who were random people, I felt like I had to defend myself, even though I knew that I had done well. And so it just made me realize that I was like, I'm gonna be fiercer than I've ever been before. I'm going to build a company because if these dudes can do it, I for sure can. I'm going to also. I love the folks in honor, of course, but it just made me realize I could do it. OK, so this is my daughter and this is Diana's daughter. This is grace and Justice. And part of what I think is important is as women, like we have to build companies differently, not pretend to be men. And it doesn't mean if your behavior is whatever, it should be what it is. But like we want to create a sustainable company that actually creates the opportunity for women to use their best selves. So when I do that, I bring my kids with me. And so this is grace and justice. And Diana and I had spent the last probably 10 years killing ourselves, right? We had that mentality where it's like, if you don't answer the phone at 3 a.m., you're not down enough, brown enough, cool enough. You're not good, right? And like, you know, we'd be like, oh, they're not cool, right? Oh, they're going on vacation. Losers, losers. What? They have sustainable relationships. Losers, losers. You what? They're not 100 pounds overweight. Losers, losers, right? We're like, okay. And so part of what shifted is we we said can we build a company that actually? Meets us where we are and and we think about it as an adult company right because part of what being in technology taught me is I was like these people look like they're 17 years old and And I was like can we build a company and not be like 17? And we just decided we would try. Okay, so this is our company. It's called Promise. I'm proud to say we are YC graduates. I just saw Gustav, who's our partner in the back. Hey, Gustav. Yay for Gustav. So Promise really was Diana's turn as I think about it. Like Diana had spent 10 years with me. I'd been like, we're at Greenfraw, we're going to work for Prince, we're going to work at Honor. So it was kind of her turn. So really the premise of Promise was how did we really work on the issues that Diana had always known were right. And so that was really about criminal justice reform. Here's what I learned. 74% of people in jail are awaiting trial. That means most people in jail have not been convicted of a crime, the crime that they were arrested for. And to me, this was shocking, right? Because when I drove by jails, I imagine it was people who'd been convicted of crimes. I didn't know that it was people who just got arrested and not just arrested but people who were arrested and couldn't afford to get out we are working in the Midwest right now in a state that I will not name we're 85 to 90 percent of those folks most of who have bails under $500. And so what that told us is, wow, governments are spending a lot of money keeping people in jail who just got arrested and didn't do anything incredibly wrong. Two-thirds of those folks are non-violent offenders. Mostly women have technical violations. They missed a meeting. They didn't pay something. That these are folks we're keeping in jail until they get the money to get out. And so that felt fundamentally wrong. What's unique, too, is that counties mostly pay for jails, and so they see the consequences. So if, for example, if you're a woman who has a kid, first you lose your job. Three days is a thing that is awful about being in jails. First you lose your job. Then after you lose your job, you lose your job. Three days is the thing that is awful about being in jails. First, you lose your job. Then after you lose your job, you lose your housing because you can't pay rent. Then after you lose housing, you potentially lose your children, or at least temporarily. And what was interesting in counties is they could walk you through how it happened. So what we knew is that the system we were building was basically imprisoning poor people and people of color and keeping them in jail because they couldn't afford to get out for mostly crimes that weren't significant that mostly people paid $500 and walked out. It's important to know $500 because a DUI can cost $5,000 to $50,000 if you have someone in the car. So $500 does not mean you've done something significant. So this was the problem we set to solve. Basically, if you sit in jail, it sucks. And it sucks because you are most likely going to lose many basic things that you hold true. And what we also learned is the longer you sit, the more likely you are to take a stupid deal. So part of what I learned is I thought, okay, so let's say I got arrested. Let's say I was in my car with my friend who does something stupid, but I didn't do anything. I didn't know about it. I can't afford bail. Four days in, I keep waiting and I keep fighting. Six days in, someone comes to me and says, you can get out. You don't have to serve any time in jail. You'll just be on probation. Then I'd say, sure, I'm getting out, it doesn't cost me anything. Then I get a ticket on probation and I go back to jail. And so these are the things I think that just for most people, at least like me, beside of course Brilliant Diana, we didn't know. There was also this incredible moment happening in time, which is first there'd been litigation in San Francisco called Humphrey, which basically said bail should go away. It's not just. The second thing that happened in California is that legislation happened with Prop 47. SB 10 just passed here in California, which actually gets rid of bail, which for us was incredible. So there was also this incredible moment. So you have an incredible moment. You have a big problem to solve. You have a lot of money being spent. What do you do? You start a company. So we started a company. And I just want to say to anyone that applies to YC, we thought we would never get in. I came in my minivan and I like drove up Diana came in these flower jeans with Birkenstocks and we looked around and they were like I swear I swear there was like no one under 22 beside two other women and these people were like I'm freezing brains I'm built a product that can tell you like what to do at night and we were like and we were like okay cool and this guy sat next to us he's like let me see your prototype and we were like so we have an idea and he's like okay who's gonna build it yeah we don't have a technical co-founder yeah and how much have you raised we don't have any money and yeah so and he's like at us, I literally said to Diana, let's go home. And she's like, we're already here. And I was like, let's go home. And we stayed. And then that night we got no call. And so the way YC works is you're supposed to get a call if you get in, but we got no call. So then Diana and I are together and I'm like, I told you so embarrassing and then like I email in the morning and I'm like so we didn't get a call we'd at least like the feedback you know kind of asshole ish in my mind and then they email back and they're like uh is this your phone number we tried to call you multiple times and I was like, oh apparently I forgot there's a one at the end. And then Michael calls me and he's like, I've been trying to call you and I was like, great to hear, so surprising, this is wonderful. So we got into YC and I say that because we got in without a tech co-founder, we didn't have a prototype. We didn't have money. We fundamentally though understood the industry that we were going into and I think that enough folks, especially women, don't feel like I just have an idea. I deserve to be in that space and we deserved to be there and that's what we learned being there but I would just say like it doesn't hurt and don and make sure your phone number's right. Okay. So then we raised money. And I know, right? And we didn't just raise money. We raised a lot of money. And this is a seed round. And the part that was so exciting is we raised it before even demo day. So we were like, we raised it. And I will say two things that I wish I would have known. One is I took money from brands that I thought validated me, which I don't think you have to do. And I thought, okay, I literally said, who's the hottest VC? And they were like, first round. I was like, okay, let's get that money. And then I... first round I was like okay let's get that money and then okay cool and if we get one we will it's working again okay so then we got money from Cape War capital who's amazing and I highly recommend because they had values that were consistent with ours 8C and Roc Nation because what's a girl from music do without a little Jay-Z, right? So Jay and what I would say is we raise this money, it would have known raising money. First what that investors needed us than we needed them. Any before, wait, they're giving me directions. Hold, I'm gonna speak like that. My hand. Oh, hello? Does that help? Doesn't help. But at least I got feedback, that's always good. Is, appreciate that. Okay, I'm gonna keep going because I don't wanna take up too much time. So here's what I would say. Brands don't matter as much as you think. Investors need you more than you need them. You need a good deck, and there's a lot of people who will give you feedback, and most decks are online and you can find. You're welcome to talk to us. We raised, and I thought we needed a lot to raise and I actually think it's easier to raise without something than it is with something and I would say the greatest value of YC for us was helping us focus on growth which we otherwise went to focused and giving us timelines to get money by. Okay long term we're building a company and what we want to be able to do is bring evidence-based decision-making to criminal justice. Meaning that right now we make decisions based on emotions and a punitive system that's really one of the most unsuccessful systems in the world. But people who actually make decisions based on data actually don't have these punitive systems. So our hope is that as we continue to build, that's what we'll do. And that also that data analytics can actually focus on equity. Because right now you don't correct for equity, so you do things like how many police interactions have you had? Well I can tell you where you're most likely to get arrested and who was most likely to get arrested. And so to correct for those type of biases. And the last thing I'll say on this before I end is that I didn't know what machine learning was or React or Java before I started a company. And I don't think you have to know those things to start a company. I don't think you have to know those things to raise a lot of money. You just have to believe you're worthy of hiring people to do those things with you. So last, we are building a company that's capable of a couple of things. One, we want to be ninjas. And the reason I say ninjas is because I think that unless we believe that anything is possible, like you're looking at a girl who grew up in the projects who now runs a company with actual revenue, which is the best thing that ever happens to you as a company, is when people pay you for your ideas. But we've been able to hire a team, deliver a product. We're doing a growth round right now because we actually had a lot of customers very quickly. We built a model with one client. We had six clients before we left YC, and those are government, so it was pretty significant. But I would just say that our belief is that we can build a company that creates the space for women to be all of who they are, the best of what they are, and build companies that are sustainable, replicable, and also build generational wealth for families who don't normally have it. Thank you. And we're going to take some questions for Phaedra, so raise your hand if you have a question please. Hi, yes. Biggest challenge growing and scaling. Yes, yes the biggest challenge growing and scaling promise. One is actually believing we could do it because there's these days where you think the product is not going to work. And so we would just be like, Diana's the, I'm usually Pollyanna, she's Pollyanna, but I'd be like, this doesn't, you know, like it doesn't work. So you're always a little bit scared and I think sometimes faking it until you make it like just like I realized I was like I need to go sell this product because we'll build it and it will have value so that was hard. Two is figuring out things like how what we should charge because we were trying to figure out like people like what's a model, what does your margin look like and we thought we needed these perfect things then we just were like let's just get a Google spreadsheet let's just add it all up it's gonna be a cash flow analysis with how much we need to make and that worked but I would say really it was just knowing we could do it because then it happened because people want your product so it's just a question of actually selling it and so yeah that was the hard oh Oh for YC work at a startup, two engineers. Hold it. This is, I'm cool. So we hired two engineers from YC work at a startup. I also want to say to all of you that held up your hands as engineers, we're always hiring engineers. So should you be interested in our mission, please feel free to connect with me. Okay, other questions? Yes. Yes. Do we feel pressure to get a technical co-founder? Yes, because everyone told us to. And then we would go meet with people and we didn't meet. This one person we liked and then he asked for crazy equity. So we had a technical co-founder because we couldn't find one. And then by the time we'd been through it, I was like, we raised all this money. Why am I now going to add a co-founder when we raised the money, we had the idea, and we now have clients? So everyone told us one YC partner who shall remain nameless said, you need it, like just go find them. And we did it. And I'm really happy we don't have one, which I know is the worst advice everyone says, but it's like we would be getting bossed around by that technical co-founder. We wouldn't know what we were talking about, so we would just let them lead. But now I understand the technology we've built. And it's so much better that way. Yes. I just have a question about selling to government as an early startup. Yes. How hard was it? What were the challenges, really? It's really hard to sell to government, especially quickly. And then as a startup, she asked, as you guys heard, one thing that's hard is because some governments require that you have to have been in business for two years before they'll contract with you. So that was difficult. The thing that we found, though, is that relationship-based sales was probably our best idea. So we didn't do outbound sales. We did relationship-based sales. We still haven't done one cold email to anyone and so that was the easiest. Doing things like having insurance and being able to understand those things were also critically important and understanding the way the government process works. We thought you had to like do all these RFPs which are two to four year processes and then we learned there were way different things that people did. We also looked at companies that were growing very quickly like Palantir and we're like what did they do because like we were like oh we are going to apply for an RFP and that will take two years and we learned they were giving product away for free in the beginning. We like we started to learn what people did to get in quickly. And that was really, really important. Yes. Oh, I'm so happy to be here. Thank you. Yay. Where? Oh, yes, yes. Okay. Okay. Yes. Got it. How do you use your difference as a woman, person of color, being different to actually secure funding. One thing I did, I think one, I was lucky because I had sold before. So our investors knew me from the last company where I ran revenue. So I think they didn't have a fear that we wouldn't build a venture company and that we wouldn't sell. So that was one advantage I think I had. The thing I think that I was also cognizant of is I think YC helps give brand, right? So I'd run revenue, I had brand, and then last is I just was really confident and I didn't apologize and if people didn't know my space, I told them they didn't know it. And I had one investor who I met with who was really rude, and I said, I think you're wasting my time and I'm wasting your time, so I'm gonna leave. And what was so crazy is then he wrote me a note that night being like, hey, I hope we didn't get off on the wrong foot. So I just realized that, and I realized that there's actually a lot of investors, so, and the mistake I made, which I would say, is now, like, I would want people to understand me before I wanted to understand them. So as I think about my next round, and then I think also knowing people, like a lot of these intros are like, go to female founder office hours, like there's a lot of ways that then the intro is not cold because even though they say they take all these ideas cold I just don't like it's so relationship based and so I would just say this but like if if there is someone I also think there's incredible networks that you can get connected to I think female founder office hours and other things and then there's incredible investors of color the one thing that I found that I didn't anticipate is that duty white guys were most likely to like me, which was not what I thought. Right? Dominique's telling me to end. And we all love her, so I'll do whatever she says. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. That was so good. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Hello, my name is Adora Chung. I'm one of the partners here at Y Combinator. I'm going to, we're going to do a panel now on essential startup advice. And so I'll introduce the fine panelists soon. So I'm going to be asking them questions, talking about applications of the startup advice we often give to YC founders. And then we're going to do some Q&A from the audience afterwards, so please queue that up while we're talking. All right. So I'll start with Christina. So Christina is the CEO and founder of Vanta. Welcome, Christina. And then Tiffany, who's a co-founder of Remix. And then Ashley, who is the founder and CEO of GemNote. Thank you. All right. Please take a seat. Thank you guys so much for coming and sharing your thoughts. So I'm going to start off with the first piece of advice that YC is most known for. There's probably signs around everywhere about this, which is make something people want. So start with Christina. Maybe you can tell us a little bit about your company and how did you know or why did you know that what you're making is something people wanted? Sorry. So I work on Vanta. Vanta automates security compliance for other internet businesses. So practically what that means is people who have internet businesses, and right now for us that means startups, come to us and we help them both be more secure, so protect whatever data customers have entrusted them with and then actually prove that security through compliance certifications so things like sock to or PCI or HIPAA or FedRAMP or like the alphabet soup of stuff you may have heard about if you work in b2b sorry and also yes so that's what Vanta does And it's about the company is about a year and a half old And my co-founder and I really started working in earnest on it last probably March April so March April of 2017 And we're both technical, but we basically spent the first six to nine months not coding And so we started with interviews, and then we basically did work in spreadsheets as consultants for three months. And to Adora's point, so when we knew we had something that people might want was when we were doing work in spreadsheets. And basically what we did was we went to friends' companies, and we were like, hey, can we security audit you and make you a compliance roadmap? And they were like, yes, I know I need one of those and I don't know what that is and just come in. And so we did that for two friends' companies, like Series B Startups in San Francisco. And then we actually started getting emails from people we didn't know who were basically like, I was at a party last weekend and my friend told me you did this thing for this company, will you come in and do it for my company? And it was really striking, probably because these people probably needed to go to better parties if they were talking about compliance at their parties, but more so because, you know, these were people who they didn't know us, we'd kind of parlayed our like friends to be like, basically we can kind of muck around in the corner of your company for a week. But now people who didn't know us are coming in and asking like, hey, I vaguely heard you do a thing. Can you come do the thing for me? So that was our moment. Tiffany? Okay, so I run a company called Remix. We work with about 300 cities around the world to help them plan out their transportation future from public transit to street design to new mobility. And I think the moment when we realized it's a little bit unconventional, my three co-founders and I, we were all fellows at a nonprofit called Code for America, and we had built a little prototype to, as citizens of San Francisco, to suggest better transit routes to Muni, and it's like a grassroots side project, and CFA tweeted it, and we were like, oh, cool. People are tweeting about this random prototype that we built. And the next day, we had gotten written up in maybe 10 different publications, design your fantasy transit route for your city. And after that, we got about 200, 250 emails from planners all around the world saying, saw your thing online, can I use it for my 2040 transportation plan in this random city we had never heard of in Europe? And that was just kind of the beginning when we realized we had hit upon something. We actually did not even know exactly what the pain point was that we were solving. So after this whole social media thing happened, we actually started doing user research in earnest. And I have an urban planning background, but not specifically transportation. And that was when our minds got completely blown open to the entire world that we now work in today. I'm Ashley Wong, and I'm the CEO and founder of GemNote. We help businesses connect with people through gift giving and so we make it very easy for companies to send gifts to customers and employees to help appreciate them. In the early days, we started off actually as a handwritten card service and our customers liked us but they did not love us. So we got feedback and one of our first customers was actually Udemy and they said, look, we like the handwriting service, but what we really need help with is this gift giving thing. We are HR managers, we're sales managers, this is not part of our job description. We are not paid to do this. We're huddling around the conference room, everyone's trying to wrap gifts, some people suck at it, some people are good at it, and then we have to ship it out, right? And so they told us, like, this is what we want, especially during the holidays. And so I kind of turned into Mrs. Doubtfire, and I was like, help is on the way. So that's sort of how we came to what we do now, which is gift giving, because our customers told us this is exactly what we need. now which is gift giving because our customers told us this is exactly what we need. Cool. So Paul Graham wrote an essay called Do Things That Don't Scale, another piece of advice we give a lot of founders. And often people interpret that as, you know, founders in the beginning, there's crazy things going on and you're kind of running around with your head cut off doing things. So curious, what's that crazy story that, every founder after a certain period has that crazy story of something you did to make shit happen. What was that story for you? Okay, so Adora knows this from working with us, but everything in the entire product for nine months basically. So high level, what the Vanta product does today, sorry, I'll tell you about the mic. What Vanta does today is get some amount of like credential information and insight into your infrastructure account or G Suite account or GitHub and then just checks a bunch of things to make sure you're doing things reasonably. And so when we got out of spreadsheet phase, the first kind of piece of software we built was a way to securely store folks credentials. So you know they authenticate with a service, we have a token, we can go pull information. And so we built that piece and so we were pulling kind of raw JSON, so just like raw data from G Suite or GitHub. And then we would turn around and we'd give people these really pretty well formatted security audits and security reports and a bunch of recommendations. And we'd be like, oh yeah, you can just put your credentials in and then we'll get you a report in like a day later. And they were like, oh wow, you know, this is so impressive. It's so great. You can do so much. And really what was happening was people would give us their credentials. We would pull the information programmatically. I would then look through this kilobytes of JSON basically and write them a report manually using the information that I was copying and pasting and then send them the report. And we did this for like, I mean, on some level, we're still doing it for 10% of the product, you know, a year later. But, you know, the first versions of, like, pretty much everything we've built have been manual. And now we're up front with customers when kind of we onboard folks and we're like, hey, you know, we're 80, 90% there. There's 10% that's not. But in the early days, I didn't really tell them that nothing was automated. We're just like, oh, we have this automated service. Sometimes the internet's a little slow, so it'll take you a day to get it, but it's definitely all technology. I'll go next. So the thing with B2G, and I don't know how many folks here have been to a trade show, is that for us, and especially for cities, it's really important to meet them where they are you can't just like email them because oftentimes you know random person emailing them is kind of weird and it's like uncomfortable so we really at the beginning started to realize that we needed to invest more in the analog in the face-to-face so one of the things that we did at the very beginning was I scoured every single trade potential transportation conference and decided whether or not I should go personally. And the first one that we decided to go to, we had decided two days before to go to somewhere in Texas I had never been to and realized, unbeknownst to me, that when you're a company, you're trying to sell to people at this trade show, you need like a booth or like a table or some sort of like presence so people know where you were had no idea this was like a thing so I go and like order like two of those banner stands and I like lug them myself to the airport one of them gets like completely ruined in transit and it's like broken and ripped I'm like half sobbing at the airport and I set up a booth which I had decided to share with another startup which was smart because it was way cheaper to share a booth. And what was amazing was when we got there, I think our industry is not used to startups generally, so they were looking at me like I was this new random stranger on their scene that everyone else knew each other from years and decades of being in the industry. And I think the fact that we had a booth, even had like kind of a chintzy banner, it made us just look like we were trying and trying really hard and I was. And the other amazing thing about having half a booth is that you just can cram more people into less, or you can cram less people into the space that you have. So it looks like your booth is more crowded. So we just looked like it was super crowded because everyone wanted to talk to us. But in reality, it's because we had really pulled a lot of random strings to get there. So that was my story. Nice. So our first year when we were going through YC, we had closed a deal with Airbnb. And that was thrilling. The first order was about 500 gifts to be sent out the first week. And of course, in front of the client, I'm like, yes, absolutely, we can do this. I was super, super confident. But then I turn around and I'm like almost in tears sobbing to my YC partners. And I was like, I don't know if I can do this. I think I've bitten off more than I can chew. I felt like I was drinking water from a fire hydrant. So I actually rallied my boyfriend at the time and Captain Yalik's cousin, who's here today, she was my first employee, and we ran with it. We fulfilled that first order. Subsequently, next month, we fulfilled another order that was 2X the volume. And what I realized was that Airbnb thought we were a 50-person company. It was me, it was another girl, and it was my boyfriend on the weekends fulfilling boxes, which is crazy now that I think about it. And now he's my husband, and so that was like the true test of love, I feel. But I learned there that founders are incredibly resilient and I think what we need to do is have this sort of mental strength that when challenges that are seemingly impossible come to you, you have to exercise that muscle in your brain where it's like willpower and I can get through anything. And so that's sort of a story that I learned and I kind of bring to the team and just my life and making sure that there's constantly this I can conquer, I can do it mentality. That's an awesome story. Okay, so next piece of advice is instead of finding a ton of people who kind of like your product, find 10 to 100 customers who really love your product. And also related is growth as a result of great product, not the precursor. So for you guys up here, how did you know people loved your product? Like how did you define that? Is there a metric that you used to kind of give you a guiding light of, okay, I've got people who love me? to kind of give you a guiding light of, okay, I've got people who love me. Yeah, so we thought about looking at things like, how often do people come back? My co-friend and I come from Dropbox, and it uses a lot of consumer startup metrics, like how many times in the last seven days did someone come back? But the fact of the matter was, especially during YC, we had like 24 users basically. And so we were like totally on first name basis with all of them and really kind of in constant communication, so like a Slack channel or a G chat or like iMessage with all of them basically. So we weren't metric driven at the time. And the like communication and chatter helped, but honestly, and this is kind of quite embarrassing, the way I think we, both new people loved us, was they put up with a website that was half functional, basically unusable, totally, basically plain HTML. One of our early customers called us the brutalist website. Which I think really speaks to our design chops. And so it was this horribly ugly, unstyled thing that had a sidebar that had like 20, not actually, but it had like 12 things in it, right? Which anyone would tell you not to do. Like don't just keep throwing things in the sidebar. And then you'd have things in sidebar and then we didn't really have much QA by any sense of what that word actually means and so stuff would break. And so people would email us. But the amazing thing was our users actually realized stuff broke and then cared enough to email us. And then you'd get these emails and be like, feel terrible. And be and be like oh so sorry like fix now like push going out to staging you know and then they'd like send some quip back that was you know mostly friendly and a little bit like why am I your QA tester but overall I think that you know it's embarrassing to tell it's embarrassing to look back on and to some extent we're at least out of the brutalist phase. But I don't know what comes after that. But I think it was a testament to also the, like, okay, something in this, like, ugly, you know, mess of raw HTML people like enough to put up with all this other stuff. Tiffany? So I think this concept of a metric to measure how much your users love you was something that we just had countless conversations at Remix about, especially because there were so many members of our team who came to join that we could measure actually maybe the successes of our customers in a much clearer way and we were also on first-name basis with all of them and so what we ended up doing is we instituted this metric which we call wins and we have like a hashtag wins slack channel and so every single time a customer at Remix uses Remix to either communicate a new concept, send their plan out to the public, or make the decision with Remix that has to do with making a policy decision or a future plan that will be implemented later, we counted that as a win. And we actually had our customer success team set goals around wins so we could really measure and figure out whether or not we were trying to achieve the impact that we wanted to achieve, not in like five to 10 year timeline of infrastructure planning, but in the much shorter timeline that a startup needed to understand. Cool, Ashley. Yeah, so GemNote sort of has, for B2B and enterprise, we sort of have a cult following. And I think it's because humans are naturally very selfish. And so these people are getting gifts from their companies. They're not having to pay for it, right? So they want nice things. And we specialize in premium products rather than cheap tchotchkes like stress balls and bottle openers. And so people are telling their friends to also use us. So imagine an employee at Google got amazing swag. They're going to tell their friends who work at Slack, and Slack is going to use us. And then Slack, they have friends at Zendesk. And so Zendesk starts to use us as well. So I think it comes from a point where it's like intrinsically we want really nice things and so we want our companies to get us nice things. And how we measure it and I would say is number one, LTV. That's really important. So lifetime value of that customer. Number two, percent of repeat business. And so if that customer is constantly purchasing from us and not going elsewhere, that's a huge metric. And then number three, we also have our customer success team send out surveys to make sure that we have a rating of our net promoter score. So how likely are they to promote us to their colleagues and to their customers? And then we also very much care about the qualitative feedback that we get. We want our customers to have this feedback loop with us to tell us why we suck, where are we sucking, right? So that we can get better and what are we doing very well that we can continue doing to make you happy and to make our service work for your company. Cool. So on one side of the spectrum, we have customers that really love you. Maybe kind of on the other side is customers that might be kind of killing your business. And so sometimes the advice is you just got to fire a customer. So I guess I'm interested in have you been in that situation before that you think about it and how did you actually execute on getting rid of that customer? Yeah. So I think for us there's been two reasons to fire a customer or think about firing a customer. One is just nonpaypayment, which, yes, but let me tell you, this can take so many forms and take up so much of your time. And this is more of a B2B thing, right? Especially when you don't have a credit card, you can just charge. That makes non-payment less likely, obviously. But the invoicing, and do they pay their invoice, and how much do you have to go heckle that, you know, anyway, that whole world of stuff. And then for us, right, given we're so small, so small, and still building out a product, I can regularly talk to folks who are like, oh, yeah, the thing you're building is great, but can you blah, blah, blah as well? And often their blah, blah, blah is totally reasonable and a thing we would like to do in like the next two years, right? And so then we kind of have this conversation of like, oh, you really want, it's a reasonable example, like full featured mobile device management for all laptops and phones in your organization. Like we would love to provide that for our customers at Vanta, but with the size of our engineering team, which is low in your organization. We would love to provide that for our customers at Vanta, but with the size of our engineering team, which is low single digits, it's not on the critical path right now, and it's not a thing we're working on. And so it's more of a winnowing in sales right now for us, so that I've learned with those folks to just be like, look, we would love to do that, but our roadmap looks like this. Here's the thing you want. Here's what we have today. Do you still want to pay for what we have? And I found that to be kind of very helpful of just being upfront with folks and like, you know, non-zero of them have walked away and been like, cool, let's keep in touch. If you have a product update list, put me on it. But versus kind of the onboarding them and then being like, oh, yes, MDM is definitely coming in 2019. That's just not a good look. So I guess one of the things that happened early on that I sometimes still have nightmares about is one of our very early customers, like, you know, first 10 customers was the transit agency up in Vancouver. And we were so excited to bring them on board because, A, they were really cool, and Vancouver's awesome, and they have awesome bike lanes, and they're just doing the trendiest stuff of any city in terms of urban planning. And then after we signed them, I was, like, up there for a sales meeting. Like, it went really well. I was totally excited about it and really happy with myself. And then I came back, told the product team that we were about to bring on Vancouver. And they were like, Tiffany, you realize they used a metric system up there? And I was like, but that's just a conversion, right? And we were only working with U.S. cities at the time. We barely had our census data up and working. And Canadian census is totally different. Basically we brought them on board because I was really forceful. And they had a terrible experience for six months. And my co-founder still heckles me to this day about this. And we had countless phone conversations about how they really wanted us to do all these things with data that we couldn't do at the time because we were so busy servicing these other customers. And it basically just turned into a shit show. And at the end of the pilot, I mean, it still pains me to say it, they churned. And so we were not able to renew Vancouver our first year. But I guess, what were we going to say? This is so interesting because you think conversion is such a simple thing, but it actually has massive impact. It's not just like metric system, but it's also like time zone changes, translations. Totally, and I'm like a designer, I'm not an engineer, so I was like oh, well, obviously it's just like a conversion. Anyways, it's not obvious. Anyways, so fast forward like three years later, we ended up turning that around. They ended up signing on board to our very, very much more full-featured professional platform at the time. And they were actually one of our first customers for our second product around street design. So happy to say that we were able to turn that one around. You're fully international now too, right? We are now. Cool. Yeah. Kind of pushed us past international now too right now. Yeah, this is very difficult for me to do because how do you say no to a paying customer? Like how do you say no to money, right? And I think I'm the type of person who in terms of customers, I'm definitely a people pleaser. And I think good leaders know when customers are taking advantage of you and when they're worthwhile. And I think it's helpful to have a second voice of reason on your team. And for me, that's my co-founder. And she is an absolute stickler for making money for our business. And you would think that I would be a little bit more obsessed about making money for the company. But I'm not. I'm, like, obsessed about making money for the company, but I'm not. I'm obsessed with making the customer happy. And so how we compromise is we ask ourselves three questions. Number one, do the Unic economics even work out? Are we making money on this? Number two, is the point of contact at this company going to be champions for us within their organization? Number two, or sorry, number three is, are they going to have repeat business? Because if they're not gonna have repeat business, if you lose money on the first deal, then you're just never gonna get them back, right? And then I would say number four, then very loosely, is that we want to have customers who are willing to give us open feedback, right? We are at a point in our company where if a customer is unwilling to get on call with us to share feedback with us or if the unit economics don't work, we're ready to say, now we good, you're gone kind of thing. So, makes sense. If you don't make me money, goodbye. Okay, last question before we get to audience questions. So, in terms of product development, in the early days you often need to iterate fast. You need to write code, build, talk to users in a big cycle. So maybe I'll start with Tiffany actually on this question. How did you at Remix, you know, GovTech is known for notoriously long sales cycles and getting, you know, I can imagine just getting feedback takes forever also. So how did you guys, what was your product development like in the early days? Yeah, so we were fortunate enough to have quite a few customers sign throughout the course of YC, which helped us raise around fairly easily. But I think what came down to it was that the feedback was not based on the sales cycle at all. They were two completely different concepts, and they could totally run in parallel in ways that benefited both our sales team and our product team. So what we would do is we would make sure that we had some sort of touch point on a really regular basis, whether it's like visiting our customer in person or weekly phone call, and make sure that everything that they had maybe bottled up during the week of using our product would be able to have a space, like a container for it to be aired. And I think the worst question to ask when it comes to user research is like, oh, like, what did you think? And then like pause. Because they're going to be like, well, it was good. Because, you know, they want to please you. They want to have a good relationship with you. So you need to get really deep and be like, what did you not like about this feature that I'm pointing to on the screen share right now? And then leave enough silence so that they're uncomfortable enough so that they have to say something. And all these different ways of digging deep and kind of assuming that our product wasn't good actually helped us give them the space to share the feedback that we need to get to make it better. Christina? So during YC, I think my co-founder was building things, and I was partially building things and partially sales support, kind of mostly. And actually, I think the best advice I got for that period in particular of trying to do everything at once very quickly Came from a solo founder who was in YC Who sort of more sarcastically I think said something about how he had two work days The like nine to five one where he worked on emails and then the like five to eleven one where he coded things And I wasn't you know I was fortunate to was an unfortunate to have a co-founder, and so it didn't have to be that extreme about it. But kind of looked at the, like, nine to five, as this is my, like, email work. And, you know, if somebody wants to schedule something at 2 p.m., like, I'm going to have a thing on my calendar at 2 p.m. I, at this stage, have no leverage over, like, people who are being so kind as to talk to me about my non-existent product, to boss around their calendars. So I started keeping kind of two lists. One was small engineering tasks, which actually often came out of support. So when people would email or Slack us something that was confusing, and it was like, oh yeah, that's just stupid copy, right? It was stuff like that I could fix in little 20-minute snippets between meetings. And then the bigger projects, which were in the evenings or on the weekends, and it's actually kind of still something I do today. So that helped. Yeah, I think in the early days your MVP should be flexible enough where you're talking to users and then planning, executing and then reiterating. So I think for us, it's similar still now and we're three years old, but we have the engineers on a one-week cycle and so we want our customer success again to be talking to our users and giving that feedback to our engineers. We're not at a size where we have PMs to help facilitate that conversation, but we actually want our engineers to know what is the business case that they're building for. We don't want them to be so far removed from the actual customer experience with the business where they're just code monkeys. They're just building features and pumping that out. We want them to be involved and be part of the tech strategy. So I would say weekly and then monthly in terms of like the meeting of the teams and making sure that we're executing. Great. All right. I actually have one more question we'll take from the audience first. Right here. I'm interested in each one of you could go down. What are the top three things that made you attractive of how you got into YC. So the question is, what are the, what is the thing that made them? Made their company. Oh. Company attracted. What made them attract? Okay, what do you think, why do you think YC accepted you? So, we should really ask Adora. But, so I think it helped that my co-founder and I come from technology, like technology companies and both are engineers. So we're kind of following the like very classic kind of early YC archetype there. I think it also helped that we had non-paying customers who very much liked us and referred other people to us. And we had something of a product for them that was actually totally manual. And I think we may have told you guys that. Basically in the like, look, we're pretty sure we can build the thing. We decided not to build it because we wanted to make sure people wanted it. We think people want it. We think we have the backgrounds to go build it. Could you help us? I think it was the short version of our pitch. If I may hazard a guess, before we applied, we had read through the YC call for startups, and there was a specific area around government and civic work, and then also another area around transportation, and we were kind of like the mix of both worlds. So I thought that was maybe one of the reasons why in terms of the space, the uniqueness of the space. And then also I had noticed YC hadn't funded a lot of government-focused companies before. So maybe they took a chance on us for that. I don't know why. You're going to have to ask Kat Mignolet. No, I was a solo. When I went through YC, I was a solo female non-technical founder. And so like literally all the odds were against me. And I would say right now, looking back, it was very, very lonely being a solo founder. But I think because of that and because all odds were against me, I made sure that before I applied to YC, I had, and it was my goal, and I always remember this number, but it was 15 customers before I wrote my application. And so I worked really, really hard on that. I hustled, and I needed to show growth if I was not technical, if I didn't have another co-founder. And so I think that probably was quite impressive to them. But yeah, you would have to ask that. Back there. Hi my name is Jasmine. So my question is focused more towards the early stages. So you know everything starts with a thought of maybe having a new product or a new service or something that's focused towards resolving a problem or anything that exists. So with an idea, there can be a period of maybe stagnation and then you have a product. So how would you define that stage or the stages where you, besides the leap of faith, how would you define that transformation or that transition into a product? transformation or that transition into a product. So I think the question in a nutshell is, it can take a lot of time to get good feedback, to get customers to tell you that you're actually onto something. So how do you go through the product development cycle and iterate through all that long periods of maybe no good feedback. Yeah, so I think this is really hard and I think people don't talk about it enough. I think there's a lot of like when you tell people or when we told people, we were coming up with an idea for a startup and people were like, oh, that's so exciting. It must be super fun. And it is super fun to whiteboard for like a week. And then you start to get really twitchy because you're like, I used to do things in the world. Now I just talk about Uber for taco trucks and like whether that'd be a good idea. You know, and if you like listen to my co-friend and I have conversations where like we played this back or we overheard other people saying this, we would, you know, be out basically. But I think so much of that process is both like, I mean, kind of being kind to yourself. Like, yes, we're going to have some silly conversations about Uber for taco trucks, but like keep having the conversations and keep learning and figuring out what that means for you guys or, you know, you all your team when you're trying to figure out a startup idea. And so for us, that meant having lots and lots and lots of conversations with other people. So our first three months, we probably had, I don't know, did what, like 100 interviews with different people in and around the security space. It was like security engineers, CTOs, VPNs, salespeople who sold security who didn't sell security, who had to deal with compliance, anyway, just all these people, and the end of it ended up being this kind of like very crisp, or pretty crisp articulation of like why compliance was so misunderstood, and how compliance is actually great, right, and in its best form, compliance is how you prove your security to other people, and third parties vetting, you know, company security to make sure they do what they say is something that's totally useful and you would want companies to go through. Compliance today doesn't quite, or the experience of going through compliance today isn't great, especially from an engineering perspective, and so it is kind of a dirty word. But anyway, it took us three months of these conversations to start to center around that idea. And there were totally times we could have stopped earlier where we just, again, you had these weeks where you're like, what did I do? Like somebody would be like, oh, you know, you're working on a startup. It must be super intense. Right? And you're like, yeah, like really intense. And they're like, okay, yeah, yeah, what did you do? And you're like, I talked to like two people this week and they told me some stuff and I like came up with some ideas and I Googled them and I found startups founded in 2014 that do the things I thought of in 2017 And I'm gonna do this next week and like I promise I'm like a really useful human like I'm contributing to society You just kind of have to like keep it. It's like this is the part I think no one talks about But you kind of have to like keep doing that because eventually eventually you will learn things that people in the market doesn't know and you will think of something that wasn't founded in 2014 or even 2018. And if you stop early, I think you end up stopping at something that you're more likely to end up stopping at something where either you're not into, you don't actually want to work on, you don't want to recruit on, you don't wanna recruit for, which is actually the metric my co-founder and I used to do the question was, do you wanna go recruit other people to work on this thing? Like how do you feel about impacting other people's lives for this, literally? Or do you just end up working on something that like, again, there were three startups founded in 2014 that did it, and maybe you can out-execute them, but they're probably not doofuses and they have four years, so not a great thing. Cool. Okay. I have one last question. We only have a couple minutes left. This is my favorite question I always ask, which is, can you talk about the best decision you made in the first year that, looking back back was critical to your current success? Start with you, Ashley. Yeah, so I think this goes back to the Airbnb story, thinking that we were a 50-person company when we were two and a half, and that I focus, my background is in marketing, branding, and design, and I focused a lot on building an incredible brand right from the start. And so design, it just builds your credibility so much. And so when people don't know who you are and they look on your website and that actually looks good, or there's a design element where it's like, oh, okay, this is very clear. They have a clear vision of what they're doing and what they're trying to help us with. I think that's really important. So I invested a lot in building the website, building the brand, and that's sort of how we've got this cult following now is because we spent so much time on that. I think when I was trying to decide if I wanted to start Remix or if I wanted to go off and get a different job, I wrote down two criteria in my notebook for whatever I chose that I wanted to do next. Number one was I wanted to work on a really, really focused problem that helped society in some way. And I'd been working at mission-driven companies in the past, but the problem was just so wide, I couldn't grab my arms around it. So I just wanted a really, really focused problem that I could care about not just a year from now, but a decade and three decades from now. And transportation in cities and urban planning turned out to be that and the number two my criteria was I wanted to work with my friends and that's it sounds so you know silly but honestly when I go to work every day when I'm surrounded by people who I love and people who I literally get up in the morning to work with that that makes me really happy. It makes me want to continue doing what I'm doing now even four plus years later. I think for us was not building anything forever. We could build the things. But when you're either doing stuff in spreadsheets or doing stuff manually, it's so easy to zig and zag and figure out what people want and really, really, really want versus the moment you start writing code, you're encoding assumptions about different parts of what you're building and implicitly and explicitly it gets much harder to change those later. Versus when you're in spreadsheet land and it's just like, oh, copy paste new tab, get rid of half of it, like try again. That's just like so much harder in code. And so because we waited so long, I mean, we had this whole backlog of stuff and all this stuff and manually and all, you know, you do create other problems for yourself, but you don't create the biggest one, which is we thought we were building security software and now we're going to go build Uber for taco trucks or something. I'm glad you didn't go build that. All right. This has been very helpful. Thank you so much, Christina, Tiffany, and Aishtali. Give them a hand of applause. Hello. I'm Carolyn Levy. I'm one of the partners at Y Combinator. And I'm here to introduce our next speaker, Alexandra Zadarin. Alexandra is co-founder and chief marketing officer of Eight, a company focused on helping people sleep better. Eight was NYC's summer of 2015 batch. To date Eight has collected over 15 million hours of sleep data which has been used to design the ultimate sleep experience. Alexandra gives back as a mentor with Galvanize and WeNYC, and she's an angel investor in female-founded companies as a Clio Capital Scout. Fun fact about Alexandra, last year she confronted her fear of open water by getting scuba certified. She's very proud of that. Please welcome Alexandra to the stage. Hi. I'm very happy to be here because three years ago, three and a half years ago, I was actually in the crowd at a female founders conference before we got into YC. So I feel like I've closed the loop. My name is Alexandra. I'm one of the co-founders, and I'm the chief marketing officer at Eight. Eight is a sleep technology company. So we use technology to tackle the problem of sleep deprivation, and in the process, we're bringing about the biggest evolution that sleep has seen in the last 60 years. Our signature product, which is a smart mattress, is used by athletes that are NFL players and are Olympic medalists to improve their recovery. But I'm not gonna get a lot into sleep or our vision of aid right now, because I'm here to tell you about our story. So first, I'm gonna back up for a second and give some context. This is where I'm from. I grew up in Tijuana, Mexico. And my cofounders are from here, here, and here. So the joke tells itself. We are three Italians and a Mexican woman. And we walked into Sand Hill Road. so you would wonder well how did I end up being on this stage so I've broken down the story of eight through the lens of love because I've come to figure out that building a company is just as challenging and rewarding as building a relationship so the first chapter of our story I've labeled romance we all know that romance is that phase of any relationship where you can't see any faults in the other and in this case it's your company you think that everything is perfect right and everything is new and exciting so for us I mean we know that romance doesn't last forever so for us romance takes us back to 2014. So back in 2014, my co-founder and then boyfriend, Mateo, was tired of struggling with sleep. So he actually suffers from restless sleep syndrome, and it would flare up during the night. So he wanted to figure out why some nights were worse than others. And in that process, he tried a few different products to track his sleep. And none of them were really working for him, primarily because none of these products were designed with sleep in mind. Back then, there was also the time when companies like Nest and Dropcam were really popular, and Nest had just been acquired by Google. And so that inspired him. And he thought, well, why are we bringing technology into other aspects of our lives and making it better, but we're not doing it for our sleep, which is so crucial for our health? So he shared that insight, aside from sharing it with me, he shared it with his friend Max. And Max lived on the other side of the country here in San Francisco. And within a few weeks, Max built a prototype of our first product in his garage. And they played around with it for a little while. They showed it to some people. They got some interest. And after two months, they invited me to join them. They said, well, we're going to make this a company. We're going to build this product, and we're going to launch it. Do you want to join? And I was supposed to take care of selling this product to consumers. And I had absolutely no experience in consumer marketing. I had a background in marketing, but I was working at a financial technology firm at the time. So I was like, this is going to be a disaster. But also, we're talking about the romance phase. So I was excited. I thought this is a great opportunity. I never thought I would be an entrepreneur. But hey, the opportunity to knock, maybe I should take it. And for context, this is what the product more or less looked like back then, so it's not very fancy. So I quit my job in New York and I moved to San Francisco to join the rest of the team. And once we were all on board, we decided that we were going to launch within a month. And we were going to use crowdfunding to launch our product because it was such an innovation that we couldn't compare it to anything else in the market. We didn't know if people were even gonna buy it. So we set a date which was very ambitious and that date came around and we didn't feel ready. We pushed it back again. That date came around, we didn't feel ready and finally we realized we were never gonna feel ready because in a startup you never feel like anything is ready. Things are always broken. So we fixed a date and we spent the next four months just working our asses off on this launch. I don't think we've ever, I could ever go through it again. Like I don't know how we were so naive to think that we could do it. But we worked really, really hard. And I think that for us looking back, the thing that was really helpful during that process, aside from continuing to work on our product development and hiring a few engineers, was actually that we did a lot of customer discovery. And other speakers had talked about this before, but as you're building your product, you want to understand what people really want. And in our case, we had an idea of what the technology could be. So we spoke to over 100 people, many of them are friends, and we asked them about their sleep. So we had to raise really awkward questions like, you know, do you snore? And what are your PJs like? And what time you wake up? We needed to become experts in our subject. So we also attended some sleep conferences and we spoke to doctors and we tried to bring them on board as advisors because we needed to really understand the problem we were solving with our product and that was really, really helpful. So as we neared our launch, I would say that we went into the next chapter of our relationship, which is becoming a couple. So in this chapter, we launched our company and we launched our product so it became a thing we made it official back in 2015 crowdfunding was super popular and there have been a few companies that had raced over hardware companies like us that had raced over a million dollars in crowdfunding and for them that meant that they were able to then secure VC funding and they were able to get some press coverage so we knew that if we could get to the million dollars it would be a really good milestone and that we could finally break into Silicon Valley. You see, even though we were based in San Francisco, we didn't feel like we belonged. We really felt like outsiders. And that's why I provided the context of where we're from. We had some funding from friends and family, but we really couldn't attract the like namesake VCs. And we felt like it was primarily because we didn't have any of the stamps that most VCS look for none of us went to Stanford or at Harvard not even an American University like they will look at our resumes they wouldn't even know where schools were we didn't work at Google or Facebook none of us had previous success that was documented by American Press. We couldn't even get into Y Combinator. So we got rejected twice actually during that period of time before we finally got accepted. So the milestone of proving success with crowdfunding was very important for us. So finally on January 2015, we launched our crowdfunding at midnight. And we had no idea if it would work. And we were very, very nervous, and we were all sleeping in the office that night. And this was our office, which was an apartment on Second Street in San Francisco. So nothing really fancy. We were all sleeping there, and after 15 minutes that we launched our campaign, we got our first order. and I thought it was a test or a joke from someone so I woke everyone up and we celebrated and we thought oh my god it's happening within six hours we had made a hundred thousand dollars in pre-orders so we spend those first 24 hours were like a roller coaster we had a lot of coverage in the press and we were answering social media and questions and inquiries through email. By day 45, we had made our million dollars. So that was very, very exciting. We celebrated, went out for dinner. And two weeks later, Matteo and I got married. So that is the four co-founders of the wedding. So through this whole time, I planned a destination wedding and the launch of the company. And it was very exciting because the wedding was almost like the part of the day when I would de-stress when they were talking about that second shift. That was my second shift every night. So it was actually really fun. And we knew that if we would have failed in our campaign, we wouldn't have such a good celebration at the wedding. So it was also very important that we went there and we could celebrate for two very big milestones. And then reality hit. So we had this successful campaign, and now we had to manufacture 8,000 smart covers to ship around the world and none of us had any hardware experience or manufacturing experience. So welcome to chapter 3. Dissolutionment and we've all been through relationships so you know what that's like. During this period of time, you know, you become irritable and withdrawn. And as an entrepreneur, you dread the question, how's your startup doing? Like, you don't want to go out. You don't want to go to any events. You don't want your mom to ask you how it's going because you feel like everything is going wrong. And that happens not just in this chapter, I got to say. It continues to happen all around. But during this time is that first time where you feel like it's the big down. So for us during this time, we had a few different struggles. The first was that we're a hardware company, so we had to have some significant capital to actually go manufacture these units. And we were really struggling to attract more investment. And one of the main reasons is that investors had recently seen a flow of companies that had struggled to deliver. And so they didn't want to get involved. And during this time was actually the first moment when Mateo and I being married became a problem. So an investor actually raised that as an issue. And I know that there are a lot of women that start companies with partners or spouses. So happy to talk about that afterwards. But for us, it was kind of crushing, just thinking that why would we get just kind of in a way discriminated for it. And the other things that we struggled with is that after the spike of pre-orders, sales dried up. So we started going through that just down curve where we felt like we would never recover and price dried up as well because who would write about something that had occurred months before. Our product wasn't ready for manufacturing yet, we felt like we didn't have all the skills to make it happen, we were struggling to hire, just everything was going wrong. And we saw a first ray of light when YC reached out. So back in 2015, YC was doing an actual effort to try to bring on board more hardware companies because they had been known for funding a lot of software startups. When they reached out, we thought maybe this will be our chance. They reached out to us. Maybe this is the moment. But we had been rejected twice. So Matteo met with one of the YC partners and we reconvened in our office and we thought, well, do we really want to spend the next 24 hours crafting an application for the third time? We really feared rejection again. At the time, we felt like investing those 24 hours was just like a waste. Like we had more important things to do. But we finally said, let's do it. This time around, we have some validation. We've sold some units. There's some sort of preorder revenue. So maybe we'll get in. We submit the application. We get called for an interview. We actually hauled into YC a mattress with our smart cover to be able to show them where technology was capable of doing. And we were accepted. So that was a really big milestone for us. We celebrated, we took all the team to a Mexican restaurant and we had guac and tequila and that really changed the course for us but it wasn't the end of the dissolution chapter. So for us, YC was a very interesting face because it was a face of rediscovery. For us as founders, like it really, I think you're exposed to so many other people around you that are all doing amazing things that you really start questioning like your approach to how you solve challenges and how you think about it and you meet people that come from like the ideal backgrounds, right, the VC's fund and so you're inspired in a way. You really are challenged by your peers. But for us also, our partners, our group partners at YC really, really challenged us. And one of the things that they invited us to do was to get units out in the field. So up until then, we had units in our own bedrooms. Like we as a team, we were sleeping in our product, and that's how we would iterate. They said, well, you need to get beta units into the bedrooms of other people. We're like, oh, shit. We don't know if the units are really going to survive in the field. So one of our first beta testers was actually Michael Seibel. And Michael was our group partner at the time. He's now the CEO of YC. But he was also our neighbor, because our office that I showed you was actually in a residential building. So this is what Michael's unit looked like. That was the hub and that thing that's next to it was the sensor strip that would go on the bed. It's so ugly that we never showed it to our industrial designers because they could cry. But eventually this thing actually we added an antenna because it was just terrible. But when this unit would fail in Michael's apartment, Max, my co-founder and our CTO, would take down the stairs a couple of flights and go into Michael's home and fix it himself. So we called it White Glove Service because it was the CTO taking care of all these bugs. But we really learned a lot. And the other thing that changed for us was the way we approached growth. So we started measuring growth weekly. So we had the spike in pre-orders and then everything started dying and so they really invited us to think about it as what progress can you do week over week, right, and just kind of take it slow, breathe, and you'll be able to recover from where you are right now. And the other thing that we did for growth, going back to the customer discovery, was we had this pool of thousands of people that had purchased our product. So we started talking to them. And we surveyed them, and we asked them, why did you buy the product? And then we used those insights to tailor our new messaging for marketing. And that was really, really helpful. So during YC, you have, you know, demo day towards the end. So we replaced the countdown that we had initially that would count down to our launch for the countdown to demo day. We had like a huge paper countdown. And we knew that we needed to prove traction. And the other thing that happens out of demo day is you start meeting with investors. So in some of these rooms actually around here, we would have investor meetings and I can still remember some of those meetings because they were terrible. In some of them, we just did like a terrible job at pitching. We didn't have a clear idea of how to describe what we were doing and they would ask all the tough questions. You're like, don't feel like you're really confident and we were like four founders sitting in there and none of us could really come up with the answers. But then in other meetings, the investors wouldn't get us. They wouldn't get our vision or they wouldn't get our backgrounds. And then eventually we found our fit. We found investors that believed in what we were doing, investors that would specialize in hardware. And that changed everything for us. Instead of trying to get the money from anyone, we went for the people that we knew would be easier to convince and also our people that still support us to date, like really, really became an integral part of what we do. So when demo day arrived, we, that's us, we logged a full bedroom into the computer history museum. We've done this many times. So that's my co-founders moving a bedroom, a mattress, and we set up a nest so you could see all the integrations, and then we had a computer that would show you live the data that was coming from the sensors on the bed. Demo day was a lot of fun. Our batch mates that were also showcasing their hardware products would actually take a rest on our bed, so it was very popular. It would get everyone's attention. Mateo, who's the guy there turning, almost facing the camera, he's our CEO and he practiced his pitch probably like 200 times. He's Italian, so he was worried about his accent and the Mexican was coaching him on his accent, so it was the best we could do. I would record him on my phone and then I would show him how he was doing and we would just go over and over and over through this five minute pitch and he would rehearse in the kitchen at the office which was also our kitchen because we were living in the office at the time so really fun times back then and then once demo day was done and we raised some money we had to make it happen we had to ship our first units and like I, we had no idea what we were doing. And what happened then is that most of the team moved to China. And I moved the office from San Francisco to New York. And while they were in China, they figured out, they found some people that joined our team. And they were there for quite a few months just making it happen. And I didn't get to be a part of that experience, so I always wish I was because I'm very proud of what they did during that time there. They had no idea about how to manufacture a product, and they just got on the ground, and they had to figure it out. I think it's one of the biggest achievements that we've had as a company, and it really gave us the confidence that anything else that we can tackle is like peanuts compared to what had to happen in China during those months. So with delays and all, like most hardware companies, we managed to ship 8,000 smart covers to more than 67 countries and during that time we dealt with higher costs that we were expecting, managing expectations of the customers that were waiting for the product, a lot of regulations and certifications because it's an electrical product that's plugged to an outlet, but we made it. And this is a picture that I took of Mateo, Jake, and David, who were two of our first amazing employees, and that's the street in New York City, and we took those very, very first units that ever shipped from our company to customers. We hand delivered those to the closest FedEx. We packaged those in our office with a lot of love because we couldn't believe it was happening. Like, it's even now amazing to think that we could make it. So if you're building something, you have no experience, you're like you can do it And I'd say that this shipment marked the entrance into the next chapter of our relationship with eight Because now we're focused on creating real and lasting love We made it through the romance. We made it through the dissolution mint We made it through launching and becoming a couple and And now the focus of what we do is different. But not because this phase comes after dissolution, it means that it's free of problems. We faced more problems in the last two years than we did in the first two. But I think we've become better at dealing with them. So now our focus is less than just surviving. And it's more on also just building a company that will last. The four of us as founders and our team that has been with us for a while, we're all very passionate about our vision. We really believe that technology can be used to help people sleep better. And that's what drives us. We're now 30 people in the team and we're all injecting our love and energy into building the best products to solve this problem, which means that as founders, we need to focus on the foundations of getting this company to survive so that ten years from now, we're still around delivering on that promise. The other thing that happens during this phase is that the stakes are higher because we've raised $27 million from venture capitalists. We have people on our team whose families depend on us. So we can take it lightly. Thankfully, during the first chapters, we learned a few lessons, many of them at YC, many of them that Adora was asking questions about earlier, that have really helped us in this phase of building a company that lasts. So I'm going to share a few of them with you. The first one that has been mentioned a million times is make something people want. For us during the four and so years of age, customer discovery and customer research has been very very crucial. I personally still to date conduct an average of 15 customer calls every month and we gather hundreds of survey responses every week. And the reason is that's how we keep a pulse on what people want. Sleep is a very complicated problem and there's a lot to learn, there's a lot to solve. And so we need to have the direct conversations with them and understand what our product is doing for them and what they expect it to do in the future. So I highly recommend that you invest the time. It will never be wasted. It's amazing and the people that you speak to who are your customers will become really loyal because they have a direct access to you as a creator of your product. The second lesson is to hire A players and it sounds very easy to say but it's really hard, especially because you want to hire people who are passionate about what you are doing, who are not there just for the job. We made many mistakes at the beginning at A, but we were also very lucky with some early hires. So one of the things that we learned is that at the beginning of the company, we were hiring for skills. And we didn't really take the time to understand what the culture was like and so what that meant is that some people would come in and they would be very skilled but they just didn't thrive in our working environment. So don't overthink culture but do spend the time to understand what's it like, what are you expecting of your team members that are just far beyond just contributing with a certain skill. The third learning is focus on what matters most. We learned this at YC, it's what they call these vanity metrics. So anything like press coverage or social media following, even capital raise don't matter if you can't get sustainable growth with good margins. And every business is different, but at the end of the day, you need growth and you need revenue. So find the metrics that are going to build you a scalable business. Implement the tools that are going to allow you to track those metrics. Track them daily yourself. Don't outsource it to someone else to tell you how they're doing. And then focus on the strategies that are going to move those metrics in the right direction. It took us a very long time to be able to focus. Most founders struggle with that because there are so many things happening. So you need that North Star. And the last lesson is find your tribe. As you build a company, you're gonna face a lot of challenges and most of the times you're not gonna have the answers for them. But what has worked for me and has worked for my co-founders is to find people who are smarter than you and who are willing to help. And whether they're mentors, investors, or just a network of peers, stay close to them, consult them, don't be afraid to ask for help. And then when you're in the position to help someone else, pay it back. This is super, super important, and it's something that for us at YC and during our time as aid, we've just, our peers, people that we were in the batch with or not in the batch with, have been so helpful, and it has made the world of difference. our peers, people that we were in the batch with or not in the batch with, have been so helpful, and it has made the world of difference. So before I close, I'd like to talk about the last chapter of a relationship. We're not there yet, but it's the chapter that I describe as using your love to change the world. And this is what really keeps us going. It's the idea that one day we can really make a dent in the world. For us, we're tackling this from this world of sleep. We believe that technology can help us sleep better so that we can be healthier and more productive. And so we want to make it happen. We want to see this become real. To date, our signature product, the 8 Smart Mattress, is used by more than 20,000 people who sleep on our bed to improve their sleep and maximize their recovery. And I'm very proud to say that we've tracked over 15 million hours of sleep that we've also analyzed to understand how different people of different profiles in different places around the country sleep. and the amount of data that we're gathering is always used to invest it back in the solutions that we can give back to our customers which means that we're becoming one of the largest sleep data collectors in the world and a path to be the largest sleep lab in the world and one day really eradicate the problem of a bad night's sleep for everyone so if you are as excited as I am about the vision at Aid, but for your own company, I would say that you just need to do it. Thank you. Thank you. We're going to do two questions. Hi, thank you so much. And I have a question about how do you manage or balance close relationship between work and life? So this is something that for me is very connected to the fact that I work with my husband. I think it's a huge advantage because I don't need to worry about going home earlier or like you know we we understand what we're going through all the time so it's really helpful. Now I'd say there's a second thing it's something that Paul Graham says as well, which is you need to exercise. You need to eat well. You need to take care of yourself. It's hard. It will always be hard if you're in a business, no matter how small or big it is. But I make that time for myself. And I use data. So I use my Apple Watch to remind me when I'm not exercising because I know that that's what's going to keep me healthy. So find the little things that for you are going to mean balance. And then make sure that the people around you, your relationships, your roommates, understand what you're going through and are also there to kind of pull you back whenever they feel like you're not taking care of yourself. Oh, there. First of all, I would like to congratulate you because your story is amazing. Thank you. And I was doing research on all the speakers and I saw the website and I'm like, I want to order. Great. So I sent the link to my husband to get it done. I have a startup in Brazil and I simulate a lot of the challenge of being a woman and also Hispanic, Latina. I think to focus on the question is throughout this entire time, did you think of getting a divorce? Quitting? And what made you continue? I know. You know what? I'm glad you made that question because people don't talk about these things and I would say that a divorce is not only because I'm working with my husband but with your co-founders, right? Most startups die because of co-founders problems. So when you get into a relationship with the people who are building the company with you, it's just like you're marrying them. I always tell this to people about like, I love my co-founder, Mateo is my husband, but I love my other co-founders as well. I really do. I feel like it's that type of relationship. And so of course I've thought about it. There are times when you hate people. Everyone goes through those moments, but to me what keeps me going is that I feel like we're all well-intentioned. We all really care for each other and we assume that we come with the best of intentions into our relationship, which I think applies to any relationship. And the other thing is the shared vision. So for as long as we're all working towards the same vision in the same direction, I'll be there. If for any reason I feel like this company is not going in the direction for where I think we contribute to the world, I'll leave because at the end of the day we're investing our lives in it but we're all on the same page, we have investors who are in the same page which is really really exciting to have that because they really allow us to build the future that we have envisioned for the world of sleep. Yeah. Thank you. Hi, everyone. I'm Kat Monyalik, one of the partners here at YC. I'm really excited Hi, everyone. I'm Kat Monyalik, one of the partners here at YC. I'm really excited that I will, I get the pleasure of interviewing our next speaker, Jess Lee. So, Jess Lee is a partner at Sequoia Capital, and she's also one of the founders of All Raise, a nonprofit whose goal is to help level the playing field for women in venture capital. Prior to Sequoia, Jess was CEO and an honorary founder of Polyvore. So we'll talk a little bit about her unusual path to Polyvore in just a second. And Polyvore was acquired by Yahoo in 2015. So before Polyvore, Jess was a product manager for Google Maps. And we'll talk about her whole path here. So welcome welcome Jess. All right, happy to have you here. Thanks for having me. And so let's talk about your time at Polyvore first. So you had a little bit of an unusual path to get there, so talk to me about it. So I started as a very passionate user of Polyvore. Someone showed it to me. I worked at Google at the time. Do you want to say for folks in the audience who might not know what Polyvore does exactly? Oh sure, so Polyvore was, it doesn't exist anymore very sadly, but Polyvore was sort of like a crowdsourced fashion magazine. It let people all over the world mix and match products and create their own outfits and then everyone came to shop. We grew to about 20 million users and then we were acquired by Yahoo and then Yahoo sold it off and then it got shut down last year. I'm very sad. But so the way I got into it was one of my co-workers at Google showed it to me and he said, hey I think you might like this. And so I didn't just like it, I loved it and and I spent hours every night playing with it. And then I wrote a note to the co-founders with some product ideas and suggestions and complaints and then they wrote back and said, these are great ideas, why don't you just come here and work on this stuff yourself? And so I did. So I left and I joined Polyvore as the first PM and one of the first hires. And that's how I ended up there. Did it feel risky leaving Google which was very established at the time for a startup? Yeah, I had a lot of people. My boss was like, are you sure this is what you want to do? And my parents who are Asian were like, uh, you're leaving Google? It definitely felt very risky but part of the reason I left was I felt like my learning had plateaued, and some of the best advice I ever got was you should always optimize your career decisions, your life for maximizing learning and growth, not necessarily optimizing for winning, which can make you a little bit maybe risk-averse. And so I realized that at Google, I was having having a great time but I wasn't learning as much and I felt like if I go to the ground floor of this brand new startup that happens to be a product that I love, I'll probably learn a lot and it feels like a once in a lifetime opportunity so I should probably go for it. And then as I was leaving Google, the VP of product said to me, he's like, you can always come back. And I realized, wow, there are some paths where you can always fall back and there are things that you kind of have to do that are, you just run out of time. And so I realized that Polyvore was one of those things and it was one of the best career decisions I ever made. So how did you, at what point did you become CEO? So the path there, I mean, I never, I never imagined that I would be CEO of Polyvore one day, but when I got there, I kind of looked around and I tried to do what I think good product managers do, which is do whatever needs to get done. That's sort of falling between the cracks. And so I wrote code in the beginning. I did product management stuff. I found our office space. So I did some facilities I washed the dishes just whatever needed to get done and what happened was Every time something needed to get done. I ended up kind of like Doing ad sales for example We didn't have we weren't making money and so I started to answer the phone when advertisers called and that turned into me being sort Of our first salesperson and then I would figure out just enough to be able to actually hire someone to run sales and then that person just kind of ended up reporting to me because there were three engineers and one product manager as I was the business person. Then that happened with the marketing department and the next department and after a while most of the company was reporting in to me because I had established all the functions the new functions and after a while the founders actually came to me and they said hey we've always thought of you as a founder you've always acted like one so we're gonna start calling you a co-founder and we're actually gonna give you some of our shares which was an incredibly generous like I look back on that I just know how rare and how special and it really shows the generosity of the DNA of Polyvore and it's always been incredibly special, but that happens, I became a founder and then a few years after that we had grown to a size where I think the CEO role had kind of shifted from being purely product market fit to being get some point as the company grows as CEO you're spending less of your time just building the product but you're building the product that is the company and that includes a lot of recruiting setting up teams correctly getting the culture right and at that point almost everyone was reporting into me except for engineering and so we just decided to make that shift the CEO at the time my co-founder came to me and said, hey I think you should be CEO now and so we made that transition and then I ran the company and then we eventually were acquired a few years after that. What surprised you most as a first-time CEO? Just when you figure out how to do something. Like you're just, you're like I finally know how to be CEO. I finally feel kind of good about it. If you're growing, if your company is doing well, it changes underneath you and then your role shifts again and you go back into this mode of like, wait, everything that was working when we were 50 no longer works now that we're 100. I have to go and redo a lot of the things that I thought were great and so you have this this feeling of never feeling a hundred percent comfortable because you're being pushed to grow and you have to grow and scale more than most people in your company and you're carrying all that burden so it's just I think that was the thing that that surprised me the most how I never felt like I was doing a great job ever and in hindsight you know I think I wasn't a bad CEO, but I definitely did not feel that way. And so I just, I think it's really important to have events like this and to connect with other people who are founders and to be able to share that burden a little bit and realize that, hey, everyone else feels this way too. It's totally normal. So yeah, that was the most surprising thing. And so what would you say, looking back at all the challenges that you faced, were there any that were particularly memorable? Oh man, so many. Every day I felt like I failed in some way. I think the hardest things for me were always the people issues. And funnily enough, I feel like 80% of problems at a company actually end up being people problems. Like you think the strategy is wrong or something's wrong with this department. It's really a person that everything can be traced back to. But I think for me, some of the most painful were in particular early employees who had been with me from the beginning. And I felt like like we're gonna get to the end together and it's gonna be amazing and then just realizing that they rather would be at a small company then go with me through the ride I didn't have the option to like I being a small company is great but when they didn't sort of scale with the company it was very painful and then also when I made mistakes with VP hiring, that's a painful one because there's a lot to undo afterwards and you just, you really want these things to work out. So I would say the most painful things were definitely multiple hiring mistakes and then early employees who ended up leaving. And what are you most proud of? If you can, if you have to choose one thing about your time at Polyvore. So some of the user love letters that we got back, we had a girl who wrote in and said, she showed us her college admissions essay, and it was about how Polyvore taught her about how you could combine fashion and tech, and that inspired her to want to be a CS major, and that was her application letter to Cornell. And that was really cool to see. And then the other thing I would say is, at some point we won, for I think two or three years, great places to work in tech. And it's one of those surveys where they actually, they do a real survey, it's a real audit. And I remember we were on the list, together with companies like Twitter and Workday. And I'm sure everyone who read the list was like, what's this? What's Polyvore? But I was really proud. Because I think we did build ultimately like a pretty solid culture. So that's one of the things I'm most proud of. What did it feel like to move on once you'd been acquired? Oh, okay. So I think the thing they don't tell you about M&A is like you might read the stories in TechCrunch and it sounds like glorious, but it's really hard. The process of selling the company was very painful and arduous. We had a very transparent culture and when we were trying to sell the company, I had to, like you can't tell your team I'm working on a transaction. So I had to have a second, like a double life where I was having these acquisition meetings, but I couldn't tell anyone on the team and my calendar had always been very transparent. So now there was all this nonsense on there like, working from San Francisco or like meeting and it was I was like in New York or pretending to be sick, but I was actually having all these meetings. It was very stressful to have to juggle that and then you just don't know what's gonna happen, right? Like you don't control the process. It's much less about you than it is about the acquirer and their timeline. So that was very, very hard. And then just when it finally happened, like it was just a total roller coaster of emotion. The day we announced, I thought, I remember I walked into the room and I thought the team was going to be really upset because we hadn't made it to the billion dollar IPO. And I was so worried they would be mad that I actually, for every employee I printed out these sheets with like what the earnings would be for each person, like how much it would have been worth, retention plus their stock. I wrote hand wrote little notes on every envelope because I was like, they're gonna be so mad, maybe this will make them a little happier. And then when I told them, everyone started cheering and I think I just started crying. I was, yeah, I was just, it's just like, as the founder, you have so much stress and burden and I just didn't know what to expect and I felt like maybe we hadn't achieved what we'd set out to achieve so they would be upset but everyone started cheering it was like a beautiful day like you know everyone was very happy to get the envelopes and it was everyone celebrated so much that day and like almost didn't want to leave the office then afterwards the integration process is really hard too because you're being sucked into a larger require. I would say Yahoo treated us incredibly well. While we were there, we shipped so many cool mobile apps. We got to build our own little lab. They were great, but Yahoo was going through its own sort of roller coaster at the time. So in many ways it bonded us, but at the same time it's hard to lose control of the things that you care about and have prided yourself on. Like I didn't control the culture anymore. I didn't control who was going to be hired or promoted. So that made it tough. So it was just a total roller coaster of emotions. So during when you had these very stressful times as CEO, who did you talk to? Who were you able to turn to for advice or even just to commiserate? Yeah, definitely other founders. I was lucky to have a few friends, like close friends, who were also running companies and could understand some of that burden and that stress and like maybe had seen some of the problems that I was seeing before, so could calm me down and say, hey, this is what I did, and vice versa. I find it especially helpful to have a group of female founder friends. I still actually meet regularly with a group of female founders, even though we're all doing different things now, and just being able to very honestly go around and talk for three minutes about what's going well and what's not is just incredibly soul nourishing. So I would definitely recommend like look around to the person next to you, make a friend and go hang out. And I feel like there's this pressure in Silicon Valley to pretend that you're crushing it all the time and your company's amazing, but that's just not true. And building a company is incredibly hard and almost irrational to even do it. So I think once you drop your guard a little bit first, you'll find the other person's like, oh my god, me too. And then you can have a real conversation and you'll feel better and you'll get the solutions and the help that you need. And so what made you decide to go into VC? Yeah, so I never imagined that I would be a VC. On the other side. On the dark side to bring the light. that I would be a VC. On the other side. On the dark side to bring the light. So, after Polyvore and as I was inside of Yahoo, I thought, what do I do with all this experience and all the painful lessons? Like, I could do it all over again. The problem is I like wacky social companies and those have the highest odds of failure. So I was like, okay, second time around my odds of success will go from, they'll double from 0.1% to 0.2%. Is that what I want to do? Is that the best use of all the really painful lessons? And I thought maybe it'd be more helpful to try to help the next generation of founders. So I thought about that. And then the second thing was, as someone who was a female founder, working on a product targeted at women, it's that double whammy of hard to fundraise. So I was like, maybe if I go to the other side, I can help level the playing field, change the ratio, and by the way, women are some of the most important consumers out there. Women run social. Women are 80% of household purchasing power. Women decide, make 80% of healthcare decisions. Those are huge markets that are sort of underserved, underfunded. Like maybe if I went to the other side, I have a shot at being a great VC if I can see those opportunities. So that's part of why I went into venture. So what do you wish you'd known as a founder now that you're sort of on this side, you're hearing a lot of pitches from founders? Like what do you wish you'd known if you had to do it again? Yeah. So this is something we talk a lot about at All Raise. And part of All Raise, there's a group of us, we do this thing called Female Founder Office Hours. And Holly Liu, who's coming up after this, is one of the co-capt now have been founders and VCs, the three of us, and we see some differences in the way women pitch. And so in particular, I think the realization that running your company day to day is really hard. But in the moment that you're fundraising, that is the moment to pitch the dream. You have to pitch the big, big, hairy, audacious vision. And yes, maybe you can show the realistic where you are today, but a taste of the dream is really important because venture capitalists are not looking for downside protection and risk minimization, they're looking for upside maximization. So you have to sell the dream even if it feels a little bit unnatural to do it, you still have to do it. And the other thing that I often see is the financial slide. I see a lot of people say even with the most conservative assumptions, I will still be a $100 million business versus I see a lot of men come in and they're like, this is my revenue projections, $500 million. They don't say this is the most hyper aggressive optimistic assumptions that you probably not very realistic, but they don't say that. And so just know that when you walk into a pitch, you represent yourself and you should be who you really are. I think that's very important. You have to be authentically you, but just know that there are other data points around you as to what other pitches look like and you just have to be aware of that and you got to go sell the dream. That's so good. Anything else if you were to go back in time? And so did you run the fundraising process for at Polyvore? Not for every round, but yes, I did it many times. Do you look back and think, oh, man, I wish I'd done it this other way? I'm guilty of this exact mistake that you made. You didn't sell enough of the big dream. Yeah, I don't think that we sold enough of the big dream. I was very focused on like look I'm gonna be a good founder because I I say I'm gonna do something then I do it Right, and I think that that's what I prided myself on and I think there's that is a very very important But there's also the like here is the possibility the dream of where we could go and I don't think I sold it hard enough So how do you approach being a VC now? Like what is your process? How do you think about, are you focused on specific verticals? Or how do you make that all happen? So there are certain sectors I spend a little bit more time in. I came from consumer, so I love looking at things in consumer, whether that's commerce or social or video. I've done, or like home maintenance, lots of different things in consumer, whether that's commerce or social or video, I've done or like home maintenance, lots of different things in consumer, but I've actually also strayed into the consumerization of enterprise. I think there's a lot of consumer best practices that do apply to enterprise. I love anything that targets the female consumer, so recently did a women's healthcare company. I also have spent a bunch of time on autonomous vehicles because I think that's gonna be one of the big consumer trends. So I've ridden in a bunch of self-driving cars and you know went to visit Detroit to talk to some of the OEMs and tier ones to kind of hear how do you take the best of Detroit and the best of Silicon Valley to create the future. So those are some of the areas. When it comes to founders, having gone through it for nine years as a founder, I think one of the most important things is grit and tenacity. I can't say that for Polyvore that we were the smartest or the best or had a better, like the greatest product, but we definitely outlasted. We just kept going when it was almost like irrational to continue and I think that's something that matters in founders. Like you have to be a little bit of a missionary, not just a mercenary because you can't last that way. It's just too hard. Like, you have to climb so many crazy mountains and get punched in the face all the time. You better have something driving you, right? It's either you're dying to solve this problem or your personality is just hardwired that way or you're, like, really mad that everyone's underestimated you your whole life, so then you just keep going. So I look for grit and some reason that you would continue when the going gets tough. How do you interview for that or how do you filter for it? Yeah, so I noticed that many VCs jump straight to like, what's the market? What's the product? I usually just ask for what's your background? Tell me your story first and that usually reveals something. And then just spending time with founders afterwards, after the pitch, just like really getting to know each other a little bit better to try to figure that out. But you know, just like interviewing, you never 100% know. After an interview, you really only know how good someone was at interviewing. So reference checks as well. So I'll do a lot of calls and personal references. What surprises you most about VC? So, I think last year was a pretty eye-opening year for a lot of folks. I think with what happened with, I think a big spotlight was shown on all the bad actors in venture and on the founder side. And it was just sort of a lot of unleashing of like bad news. But in that moment, what I really appreciated and maybe surprised me was how the women rallied. So Aileen Lee from Cowboy Ventures, she's amazing. She's one of the OG. She was like she first female partner at Kleiner. She's incredible. She started her own firm, Cowboy. She sent out an email asking a bunch of women partners, why don't we get together for dinner? And why don't we, you know, see if we should, maybe there's something we can do together. And I was really excited because I was pretty new to venture, maybe six months in. And I was really excited to meet all the women VCs. And when we got there, I realized that not everyone already, even though they had been in the industry for a long time, they didn't all know each other. Everyone had been very siloed for a long time. And as I started to think about why, I realized when you're a founder and you run into another female founder, the odds that you are direct competitors are almost zero. With VC, the odds that you're competing against each other for some investments very high And so there had sort of been this feeling of like there can only be one That it caused the women to maybe not gel as quickly as they could have but that started to happen last year and it was really incredible to just accelerate all these friendships get to know people like it definitely accelerated my learning in venture capital and From that we spun out a bunch of different initiatives, female founder office hours, founders for change, VC sort of community. And then we invented a nonprofit called All Raise, which I totally did not expect that. So that was probably the most surprising thing, how siloed it was and how quickly that changed. And so can you tell us a little bit more about the particular, like what does AllRays look like moving forward as, you know, as you said, it's been a year since Me Too and all the stories came out. And so what are the main initiatives you're working on right now? So the goal of AllRays, the mission is to create a more diverse ecosystem in tech, right? Like I think at the end of the day, if we look back in 10, 20, 30 years, I would like there to be more female icons, iconic women in the tech ecosystem. I would like everyone, it should just not even be a question that female founders are incredibly capable of creating massive companies and that female VCs can drive huge returns right. I think one of the shifts we're seeing is with with MeToo and a lot of what happened last year, I think a lot of people were operating out of fear like oh I don't want to get caught, I got it I got to fix things. I would like to see that conversation shift to also include greed, which is if I don't invest in women, if I don't have women VCs, I'm not going to make any money. Because women are big business. So that's what we need. I think we need to create more Katrina Lakes at Stitch Fix. We need to create more Julia Hartzes at Eventbrite. We need all of you to be incredibly successful and we need to work together to help make that happen. So that's what I'm most excited about. And I think that's where All Raise is going and has been going for the last year. We started as a group of about 30 female VCs, but that's expanding to include founders. So we have a lot of founders who are coming on board to help because the two actual measurable goals that we created were one, we want to double the percentage of senior women in venture capital, which is currently at 9%. And then on the founder side, we want to increase the percentage of dollars going to female founders from 15% to 25% in five years. So those are the goals. You know, they could always be revisited. 25% in five years. So those are the goals. They could always be revisited. But really, to me, the North Star is iconic women in tech. I love that. We want all of you to be icons. So we're looking at you. That's your job. Yeah. So we only have about five minutes left, and I'd love to open it up to questions. So let's take a few. We got one right here. So the question, and I'll repeat it, is Jess talked about the double whammy of being a woman and a female-focused startup. So what are the tips? Yeah, so I realized when I started to pitch that I used to try to rely on empathy. Like here's the problem, you know that moment when you open your closet and there's nothing to wear. And I realized that the male VCs were like, I have no idea what you're talking about. So don't rely on empathy, right, Like necessarily. Like what I started to do is I started to try to draw analogies. So what I did was I took a stack of September issues of Vogue, of Elle, of all the, you know, the big thousand page issues and we would throw them onto the table and say, these issues, that's a hundred million dollars of advertising dollars on paper. Imagine that on the internet and then it clicked. So talking about the numbers and quantifying how large the market is and what you're trying to do, that made a really big difference. Next question, Sharon. Hi, I'm Danielle. I'm a designer. So do you have any advice on, because I currently have a few ideas. I don't know which one to proceed to execute. Do you have advice for non-technical founders like me? Thank you. Yeah. It's great to have multiple ideas. I would say that as YC knows, you have to build something people want. So I would probably get out there and try to test those ideas as quickly as possible. I'm a big fan of something called fake door testing, which is essentially like imagine a mall and you want to know if there's, it would be a good idea to build a candy store there. So instead of building a candy store and constructing it for a year, just put a door that says candy store and see if people try to walk into it. So I call it fake door testing. So you could, for example, create three landing pages and run Facebook ads and see which idea actually gets the most traction. You could go to Starbucks and sit there and like give people $5 gift cards in exchange for like them giving you feedback on the idea. But I would say the first thing to do is determine which of the ideas has the most legs and the one that you're most excited about. I have a question over there. Hi, my name is Erin. I work in the augmented and virtual reality space of immersive tech, esports, AI, and blockchain. Yes, I know it sounds buzzwordy, but all the things. In my space, it is very difficult. I'm currently releasing a book under O'Reilly Media in March. My co-editors are male. I strive to get as much of technical and creative contributors to be female. That's hard to get above 33%. Outside of the building a fund and a startup that is stealth and two nonprofits dedicated to diversity inclusion focus on Filipinos in tech AR VR and women in tech I find it so difficult still because I think you working on a product for polyvore being women focused I look at AR VR and I don't see that as a men's product. I don't see it as a women's product I see it for everyone, but our numbers are not as high. I know Etsy has taken strides to change the culture to have more women engineers, so I'm wondering in terms of your backstory of Polyvore becoming a co-founder, which I can't remember and I'm sorry if it was all male, not male, how did you manage with other teams? Between co-editing my book and launching my app on Oculus that's also releasing in March, it is all-male and it is difficult. So I would like to hear your feedback on like how do you change the ratio and culture if you are in a leadership position? So I think a lot of the literature out there, the articles that guide you talk a lot about what happens before people get there. So the recruiting pipeline, right, how to focus on getting women in. I think a lot of it that's not written about that's important is how, what it's like after you get there, inside of the company, what's the culture like, is it parent-friendly, for example, is it meritocratic, so I think focusing there, once you do that really, really well, then you start to see this virtuous feedback loop where the women there are really happy and they feel like, I've never been in a workplace like this before where I felt so equal and felt like I had flexibility and was totally trusted and then they bring in, you know, it just that attracts. I actually think that's the place to focus the most. A few things that, just some tips. I think it's very common for, at work, for social circles to form, right? And for activities, like maybe you go out and some people go and have movie night or maybe play golf together or like whatever it might be. It's totally normal to have social stuff, but I think you have to be very, very clear with your company that those social events are for socializing and not for let's chat about work and make decisions where some people are not included. And it happens sort of, like I think most people don't mean to do it, right? It's just like, oh, we're together, why don't we just talk about that project?" And they forget like, oh, because we're playing golf and that's actually mostly more male than female, like we actually left out the VP of product who's a woman. So just really make sure you talk about that at your company and make sure that people try to follow that rule. But don't discourage socializing. I mean, I think that's really important. That's one small thing. The other is accountability, right? If you just have a culture of accountability, of self-reporting, then that sort of evens out some of the tendency for things to not be meritocratic, right? Clear metrics, clear reporting on the metrics, retrospective, so each team at Polyvore would send out sort of what's going well, what's not, what do we need to change, and who do we want to give kudos to? So you can see kudos right, this is basically just agile process but we had everyone at the company just do that on a regular cadence. The other thing it does is it makes you talk about what's going well and what's not going well. So that sort of creates the understanding that of course some things are not going well and it's okay and we have to be honest about it have to talk about it. So I think that does multiple things, but it also makes things better and a more equal playing field. I would also say you just have to be authentically you as a female leader. That was one of the hardest things for me was to figure out how do I want to be a leader and do I not be feminine in the classic way or do I try to be masculine? I tried copying so many different styles of leadership and it just didn't feel right until I finally said, okay, I am who I am and let me just try that. And I was able to figure out what my strengths were and then play those up and lean into that. And then for everything that I wasn't good at, hire around to manage my weaknesses. And then just realize that I thought I wasn't a natural leader because I didn't see role models that behave like me, but really the duty is for me to be that and to be authentically me so that other women can see that. The next generation's like, oh, that's a female prototype of a leader, so I would say it's hard, it's the burden of our generation to have to do that, but you just have to do that. Thank you so much. Hello, hello. Thank you all for being here. This is awesome. My name is Stephanie. I help run admissions at YC, and I wanted to let you all know that the deadline to apply is October 2nd. If you have any questions, you can find me out there during this break that we're about to start, 25 minutes. You can also email me, stephanie at ycombinator.com, Stephanie with a PH. And quick note that there are extra bathrooms outside and to the left. Okay, thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Can everybody please take your seats? I got crowds shushing duty. Hello? Hello? Thank you. I'm going to cry. Oh, Kirstie says I should pretend I'm talking to my kids, and that will get everybody to pipe down. Okay, are we ready to start the last part here? So I am up here to introduce you all to Holly Liu, who is a part-time visiting partner here at Y Combinator, and she was the co-founder of Kabam. Kabam started as a corporate social network, then turned into fan communities for TV shows and sports, then exited as mobile gaming. Holly was in charge of product design and was lead designer on their flagship franchise Kingdoms of Camelot, a game that grossed over $250 million in revenue. She later oversaw the worldwide people and culture function. Kabam grew to over 1500 employees and was sold to Netmarble and Foxnet in 2017. Holly and I discussed her coming up here to do an interpretive dance, but I actually think she's instead going to give a talk, so please welcome Holly. Hi everybody, welcome. Thank you for those tuning in and those here, and thank you Carolyn for that great intro, no interpretive dance, sorry guys. It would probably just be me in a ball curled up. But I'm so excited to be in a room full of female founders here at YC. I really wish you guys were around and YC were around when we started our journey because I'm pretty sure the name of our talk would be incredibly different. Basically, I would have been able to learn from all of you in the room and all of the YC Company failures and maybe the talk would have been something about like three steps to a billion dollar company. Instead we decided to make our own failures along the way. As Carolyn mentioned we started as a corporate social networking company and exited as a mobile gaming company and Basically made three startups along the way so I wanted to share with you our story As well as some things I wish I would have known Before we started, but we were just too far in I just want to tell you a little bit about me I'm the daughter of two very loving Chinese immigrant parents. This is me sitting very unladylike. My father used to tell me growing up that it's easier to go from Harvard to McDonald's than from McDonald's to Harvard. And for those of you who don't understand Chinese dad speak, the translation is basically shoot for the moon, and even if you miss, you'll land among the stars. Well, I did not go to Harvard. I didn't end up at McDonald's. Instead, I landed among the stars with some accountants as an internal auditor. I think my grade at this point probably would have been a solid C, and you and I both know that's really an Asian F minus. see and you and I both know that's really an Asian F-. And worst of all is this is what I felt on the inside. Not like a man but just really trapped. Yeah I'm really sorry they didn't have any other pictures, they didn't have any pictures of Asians but this is really how I felt just completely trapped in an accounting company. I felt like a square peg in a round hole. Because up until then, my mental story of success had to do with this, helicopter parents. So growing up, this is the 80s, 90s term for tiger parents or tiger moms. So basically what helicopter parents were, which were my parents, is they would make sure that the child had everything that they needed, like eating and sleeping, are you eating your vitamins, so that you could do well in school, so that you could get good grades, so that you could and you could see it was the circle of life for me and what the mental model of what success looked like. But unfortunately, the circle of life definitely started feeling like a conveyor belt of life. It really felt like life was happening to me rather than me making life happen. And if you're really feeling like life is happening to you, you should really question whether or not you're doing what you're supposed to be doing. If you're feeling like you're on the conveyor belt of life, it could be because you're not living what you're supposed to be living. So after 18 months, instead of having life happen to me, I needed to make life happen for me. So what I did is I decided to quit my job and go back to what I knew, which was school. I knew how to take blue book exams and scantron tests and I ended up getting into a graduate program at UC Berkeley in information management systems and that led me to the Bay Area and I have never turned back. I'm so so grateful for coming here because here I've been exposed to the creative people that have built the technology as Well as seeing how technology can not only change us as people but really the world So let's fast forward to 2006. It's seven years after the dot-com boost a boost calm bus, excuse me Five years from the 9-11 and two years before the financial crisis. At this time, the web had already gone through an evolution. It had evolved so much that we had this thing called Web 2.0. That was a huge thing in 2006. On top of that meant like bloggers could publish at any time. There were places where anybody could be a publisher. YouTube was taking it by storm. And in fact, this was the year that YouTube had sold to Google for over a billion dollars. And that's when we said, hey, this really might make a lot of sense. If Steve and Chad could do this, maybe we could do this too. We didn't realize how naive we were. So these are my co-founders. We decided to quit our Silicon Valley jobs and decide to start a company. We had no idea what we were doing. As I mentioned, YC wasn't really on the West Coast at that time. So we had to raise some money in terms of very traditional type of seed money where we had to knock on doors up and down Sand Hill Road. We only got one yes. And honestly, I think it was a pity yes because it was my old co-founder's boss. He had worked at a VC company and Maha, who was working at Canaan, decided to put 500k in us with no product and really we didn't know what we were doing. Our product was though thinking that everything was going to be democratized, we're like we know exactly the next place this is going. We're seeing this on video, we're seeing this in publishing, the workplace really needs this. Employees are really going to want to tell what their bosses exactly what they want to think. They're going to be super transparent about it and you know what, bosses want to know everything that employees want to know. We gonna democratize the workplace don't forget that about a year before that somebody was fired from Google for blogging but nevertheless we persisted we persisted for seven months for seven months after three product iterations and a ton of spamming as well as cold calling and begging our friends and family to use our product, only about 1,400 users had just signed up. We didn't even want to talk about active users. I don't even know if my mom even signed up. So basically we had ignored the first rule, which was make something that people want. This was something that we were like, hey, we raised some money, of course people want, of course this is good, this is great, right? Like we can do this. No, nobody came. So we got into a room and we sat there and we said, okay, maybe we should just return the money that we have left and find Silicon Valley jobs. Later I found out from Maha, our investor, she said it wasn't even worth taking the money back. It was so little, it wasn't even worth the tax paper write-up for the write-off. So we continue to sit there and think, like, well, what makes sense? And about the same time, we were very lucky. This thing called Facebook released a developer platform. And I remember when we were talking, we spoke to Maha about, you know, maybe there's this thing, like Facebook's growing and they're doing this new thing where anybody can now develop and maybe build something there. And she kind of looked at us really funny and she's like, you guys have no users on your platform. You guys should go to where the users are. And that's exactly what we did. And that's the one thing we learned is that if you can't make the users come to you, then you should go to where the users are. For us, this was incredibly important as Kabam because this became almost very ingrained into the very foundation of how we think about even games that we release, any other future company that we built at Kabam, you'll see it was very market driven. So we got into a room and we started out with a clean slate. It wasn't a blank slate. It was a clean slate because we wanted to learn everything from that product, why people didn't use it, where we went wrong. And one of the things we realized is, you know what? People really don't care about work, no offense, like they just don't go home and like Google about their co-workers, only if it's super salacious, but like nobody cares, right? And so we even found that we would leave work early, particularly on Monday nights to go watch 24 and Heroes and run back the next day and just spend our time talking about it. And there was really no place on Facebook to be able to connect these fans together to share photos or quotes. And so we decided, you know what, why don't we do that? And so we did it. We started building fan communities for TV shows and soon sports teams. And this did phenomenally well on Facebook. We were there in the beginning, it was growing and we ended up growing our user base to over 60 million registered users and when Facebook wanted to distribute, sorry excuse me, when ABC wanted to distribute their video on Facebook, they didn't call up Facebook, they called us up. So we were distributing episodes of like Grey's Anatomy through Facebook, we were the only place that they can get it. Well, we were doing quite well as an ad supported business and we were still managing some of pieces of, for those of you who know ad supported businesses, still have lots of things to support as well as being on a platform that we fully didn't control. Then 2008 hit. 2008 was just one of the worst times to be a founder. It was startup apocalypse. So you all know what happened with the mortgage crisis. You probably have friends who have lost houses, which is unfortunate. And Sequoia, like the top VC firm, basically sent out a whole deck to all their portfolio companies and said, okay guys, you need to get to cash flow positive. These are people who make money off of growth and they're saying get to cash flow positive and they pulled back on their investing. They're like, RIP good times. And ten years ago, actually today, we were waiting for a wire from a term sheet we had signed from our series B and it was just crickets. It was like the worst. And then with the ad-supported business, within a financial crisis that was looming, all the monies dried up, like almost literally overnight. We had no money coming in. We had a $3 million contract disappear, and then the ad revenues dropped to pennies on the dollar. So we were then again really stuck of what should we do? So we got into a room and we started talking about these three things. The first was kind of, well, we know if we continue to persist the way that we're going we are going to persist into oblivion. So what is going very well? What are things that we can tackle that's going very well and what are our passion points? Well there was this thing called Facebook games that were really like people still were playing games and they weren't just still playing games it was a new thing it was Farmville, it was Cityville. We were spending our time playing these games, and we learned that games were doing really well in a recession. The second thing we realized is between the 30 of us, we had almost over 100 years of Facebook app building experience. We're like, hey, if you wanna build an app on Facebook, we know how to do it. And finally, we talked a lot about what were our passion points. And literally, I think if anybody loves to play games, they know that sometimes it can be really good when you're depressed to go escape for a little bit. So there's many hours of us either watching people play Halo or other me watching coworkers play Halo and my coworkers playing Halo as well as we would spend a ton of our time. In fact, we had two Christmas parties where we just stayed in the office and played Settlers of Catan. Those were just the hot games at that time. So for some reason, we were like, I think we can do this. So we took two engineers that really loved games and said, you know what? We don't wanna build what's currently out there. We wanna build something that is more engaging and something that doesn't quite exist on Facebook. So we came up with Kingdoms of Camelot. This was our first...one of our first iterations of our game. We chose Camelot because it was public domain. That means you don't have to pay for the IP. And it was extremely accessible. Many people understood what Camelot was. And we didn't really have a lot of money, so we had art students come in and help us do the art. And then when we decided to try to test it, and user test it, we decided to ask our friends and family. So usually you're a little careful when you ask your friends and family, because you're like, maybe they're just gonna be too nice nice and they're not gonna really tell me what they're thinking. Well I learned something new about my friends and family they were so mean. I was like oh my gosh they came in and they said this game is stupid I don't understand this how come nobody's in the chat room I don't know why you have to click on this where do I click for resources for those so for who are unfamiliar with strategy-based games or empire building games, basically it's a bit more of a three-step process. You have to spend your time like farming for some wood and farming for food and then you grow that and then you can use those resources to build your kingdom and get your buildings to a certain level and then you can raise an army and then you go out and attack. And that's really what happens. And it's a pretty complex game in some ways in terms of that. It's pretty long and you spend a lot. Well, anyways, I was shocked. I'd never been through. We spent about a week fixing what we could. And when we launched our game, there were parts of the game that weren't even built. And we're like, well, maybe they just won't get there on day one. So it's okay. I'm so glad that we did not wait to launch. The main reason why you shouldn't wait to launch is that we would have been fixing things that didn't need to be fixed. We would have been working on things that didn't need to be worked on. And I'm frankly really glad we didn't listen to our friends and family that night. They said that the chat was really boring, there was nothing to do, maybe you shouldn't even have that. But what was amazing is when they started, when the game was launched, people were chatting. And what we realized is all the current games that were out there is you had to have an existing friend graph with somebody to send them a cow. And after a while, nobody wants purple cows. And what was happening in our game is that people, strangers were meeting and becoming friends based off of interest. Actually very much similar to our fan communities, right? Like just because you like a particular TV show doesn't necessarily mean that your friends will like that. And so we were making these new connections through this game. So I urge you guys, if you guys are sitting there thinking about should I launch or not, I urge you please don't wait to launch. In the gaming industry, we talk about you might be polishing a turd, so launch. So fast forward a little bit further, we're now on our series C. The game itself has grossed over 100 million at this point. We haven't even launched on mobile. And this is 2011, and Facebook decides to enact a 30% tax. This gives us a huge dislike for them. We were really upset, along with many, many developers, because Facebook had promised that there was no, like they would never, ever tax the developers. They were gonna be super developer friendly but for us the other reason why we were really upset is how we grew was mainly through paid advertising. We bought a lot of our customers. Now just a word of caution, I don't think it's the best thing to buy your customers. This is mainly because at some point it's only because that channel is very good and you're having an arbitrage opportunity. You still have to build a really, really great product. But because we knew all these numbers and every dollar that we spent, we knew the ROI, we knew our LTV which is lifetime value, we also knew our CAC which is the cost of acquiring a customer. And you always, always have to make sure that your cost of acquiring the customer is lower than your lifetime value, right? We knew immediately that when Facebook would enact this tax, it would be a 30, it would kill our business. So at this point, we were already 400 employees, we had a board now, and we had to rally people around this idea that we need to somehow expand past Facebook. We didn't even have kabam.com, we weren't even on mobile. It was really, I think the board really looked at us kind of crazy saying like, hey you know are you guys really like you're basically killing the goose that lays the golden egg. Even internally our employees, we had to give like a firm edict. Anybody launching a new game cannot launch on Facebook. They need to find their revenues elsewhere. And finally, we took our co-founder and we placed them all the way in China. And we said, you know what? We can't even build a mobile team at our own company anymore. So we need you to go build this mobile game, build the mobile team, build the game, and take Kingdoms of Camelot onto the mobile phone. And what we did is we did just that. We took it onto the mobile phone, and that very next year when we launched, it became the top grossing app in 2012. So this beat out Facebook, Pandora, any others. And it really, really was the first time for in the gaming industry, an in-app purchase reached to such great heights. So every game thereafter now launches with in-app purchases. There's still some premium games, but it's just not as big. All the big gaming companies do this. And so this really set our trail off onto being into mobile. Now, we had a lot of failures as a mobile gaming company. A lot of changes happened along the way. But this is really what got us there in terms of some of the failures. Now, what I wish I knew at this time was I wish that I knew or more so believe that instead of having life happen to you, you should make life happen for you. There's really nobody else that's gonna live your life for you but yourself. And the mental story that you tell yourself is actually not only the most important story but the most persuasive story. The mental story I would tell myself as a founder all the way to exit was that I was incompetent. Eventually, I wasn't the right person, and that all led to I didn't belong here. But I'm here to tell you that you are the right person. As a founder, you know the vision of the company, you know where it's going. And I'll let you in on a little secret. Everybody's incompetent. There's nobody that is the right person. It's very much for those of you who are parents in the room, you all know that you didn't come with, like your kid did not come with an instruction manual. And for those who don't have kids with, your parents are incompetent. This is why there's so many problems. But they're your parents and you're the right person. So for all of you who are starting a company who is a founder, you are the right person to be running and building this company. It's your dream, you should just do it. And where you are right now should not and does not dictate where you go. So 10 years ago today, a wire did not come into our bank account. Nothing. We lost $3 million contracts and ad impressions were dropping to pennies on the dollar. And last year, we sold for over a billion dollars. That's... So, just know how shitty and how bad everything can look. That doesn't have to be your future. Because remember, you can always have failure without success, but you cannot have success without failure. And I hope to see you all on your billion-dollar 11-year overnight success. Thank you. I think we might have time for questions. Yeah. They left me all alone. Hello, can I ask? Oh, thanks. Sorry. What happened to the first check of $100,000? Was it wasted in your company? Where is the C check? It was the same company? Yeah. Yeah. So we were actually incorporated as a company called Water Cooler. So on the documents in Delaware, it'll be Water Cooler Inc. And then we changed our name to Kabam because we knew that nobody would go to water cooler dash Inc comm to play games because we're like okay once we're a gaming company we're like okay we can't change it anymore so we were water cooler for the longest time Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah. So the question is, is why did we send our co-founder to China to recruit? And it sounds expensive to do it here. Yes, it's very expensive to do it. It sounds expensive to go over there. Is that what you said? Oh, okay. So this is gonna sound super... It's just gonna date us at the time, but there just wasn't a lot of mobile talent here, as well as also internally, there was already building a team of mobile talent. They were trying to get some things off the ground. They were doing HTML5 games. And at this point, it was really a little bit of the edict of the CEO to say, you know what, we need to move faster, and it's best if we could just take something out and move it over there. At the time, the office had already started in the China office. It just wasn't quite doing it. It was building like Facebook games. And the funny thing is Facebook is you can't get access to Facebook in China, so all these Chinese employees didn't know what to do. But sending a founder over there is really important. If you ever build an overseas office, it's very important to send early employees or cultural ambassadors over there, especially if you want them to be very tightly aligned. But it was just a thing about speed and focus in all honesty I guess in the back yeah so the question was people don't normally think about Gaming as a female female oriented space. So how did I navigate being a woman in in the gaming world? So I have a lot of thoughts on this So the type of games that we built this is eventually we turned into triple-a mobile Gaming company with a lot of IP. Our largest game right now is actually Marvel, Contest of Champions. But I have a very strong feeling about even the term gamer. I think it's quite sexist. Oftentimes, so it is very true. I have a confession to make. I would not be considered a gamer by the gaming community. My keystrokes per second are very slow, or sorry, actions per second, see I don't even have the terminology right. But everything is, I think that that world is very much saying that, oh you can't be a gamer because you don't play these types of games. And I think that's really silly. Oftentimes I do very much hear, I do hear this more from women than men when they hear I'm in the video game industry. They always tell me, oh gosh, I'm so sorry Holly, I just don't play video games. And I always tell them, well I really believe it's because there hasn't been a game made for you. It's like to me, how can there ever be, how can somebody not like playing games? It's just that like when you're six months old that's how you learn, right? You're playing peekaboo. I just think that the gaming industry does need to have a bit more diversity in terms of game making and I'm looking forward to the day where the tools can drop so that you can have much better, much more types of games being made by different types of people because I do believe that everybody loves games at some point. So that's, sorry, I have the mic and the soapbox, so I decided to get on the soapbox and say that. But in terms of navigating the space, it was very much, some of the things were very strategic on the ways we wanted to go, and it just happened that mid-core to hard core was going to work much better in the gaming world. I tried very, very hard since I designed Kingdoms of Camelot. I was a UX designer on it and my job was actually to make it viral. We tried really incredibly hard to make the game very social and very viral. We had some women, and some of our games have about 50% women, like our Dragons of Atlantis did. By the way, everybody loves dragons, FYI, men and women. So some of them did get to about 50-50 parity, but oftentimes within the industry, it's just a really tough industry, and we had to make our bets in a certain way Given how casual games are and how they're they monetize and everything. Sorry. Sorry if I threw out too much jargon, but Yeah Go ahead Yeah . Way too late. Way too late when I realized it, probably after I sold the company and said, oh my gosh, this whole time I've been wasting my time. There were so many things that I could have pushed forward within the company that I probably didn't do as much, mainly because I was like, well, maybe I don't belong here or this just isn't really me. So I think it was just a bit too late. And if I were to be truly honest, still learning, that's just this old tape in my head head and I realized how much it was guiding my actions during that time. I think it was a process of several conversations of just after we sold our company trying to really think and reflect on like okay what should I do next or feeling like I always tell people some people ask me what it feels like I go you know it feels like you've been running on a treadmill at speed 7 or 8 and then you're getting off and your feet are still wobbly that's kind of how I've been feeling in many ways and thinking about some conversations about paying it forward as well as doing a lot of work here at YC. Being able to pay it forward that way has enabled me to do some of that as well as some books on personal development as well. So it's a ton of conversations. One more or no more? No more, that's what Kat's saying. She's giving me the side. All right. Well, thank you very much. Thank you all. All right. So we are going to do onstage office hours. So this is something we do at YC. We meet with startups and we go talk about the problems and try to help them out. And usually each session is around 30 minutes each but we're going to try to do two in less time. So the first guinea pig will be be Pad Piper. . . . . . . . . . . . . . what are you working on? Before I say that, I do want to say I have two other co-founders and they're great, but they're not here because they're guys. But Pad Piper is an online housing marketplace that helps interns find furnished affordable monthly rentals. So through Pad Piper, landlords come to the site, they list and manage their rentals, and students browse, book, pay for, and leave reviews of those rentals. So we had worked on this for two years part-time and built this C2C marketplace that students loved. Over 2,000 students signed up through word of mouth, which was kind of incredible for having a very full daytime job. And then this July, we decided to also quit our Silicon Valley jobs and go full-time, which was awesome. And so with that, we are focusing on a B2B program actually called Pad Piper for Employers. And this directly integrates with our marketplace to allow premium services through the marketplace. And this includes things like taking companies interns and matching them with housing and roommates that are suited for their interests. So can you talk about your numbers? Like how many matches are you doing in the marketplace per month right now? Sure. So we just had a paid pilot this fall, which we did not expect, but was challenging and exciting. And with that, we matched 20 interns. How are you paid? Per intern. How much money per intern? Like what's your take rate? Sure. So I'll say between $300 and $600 depending on the company. I see. Oh, per intern? Per intern, yeah. How many interns can you match in a year? How big is the market, I guess, for this? So we're focused in the Bay Area right now, which has about 30,000 interns coming every year. So when you hear the word interns, you do think of just summer interns, but lots of schools now have internship programs or work integrated learning programs that are year-round. How is this different from employers finding corporate housing for their short-term employees? Why are they coming to Pad Piper? That is a great question. Right now, it really is the internship focus side of things. So one of their biggest things right now is that they don't fit into their corporate housing, nor do they really, in terms of the services that they're offering, nor do they really want to put them in corporate housing. The employers don't want to. Is it that they want to put five interns in one room and save money? No, it's actually not around money. It's more around limiting the number of interns in one space. They see as more interns are in a larger apartment building, it can be troubling or maybe just not as authentic of an experience when they just move here and live in a singular home. So why do companies want this in particular? One of the things, the purpose of internship program is for recruiting, I'm assuming. So yeah, but they don't spend as much time or money on interns, obviously, as the rest of the employees. So why this versus, say, corporate housing? Right, so right now, again, it doesn't really fit into their full-time life. So at some point we would like to expand beyond interns, but right now we're focusing on that market and capturing that. It really is a lot of university recruiters at these companies are spending 60 to 80 hours helping these interns because they don't fit into their systems. So they're literally just sending them links, sending them Craigslist links, and it's just really inefficient. I guess I don't understand the, when you say like fit into our systems, because there's definitely a lot of corporate housing that already exists. Like what does that mean? Like I could just send them the link to my point person at corporate housing. Yeah, I think it's one, they don't always have corporate housing, but secondly, because those corporate housing is typically for a longer period of time. So it's hard to fit in, let's say, you know, 50 to 75 interns for four months and it has to end on this date. And then that leaves a big vacancy in that corporate housing too. And then when you're matching, are you doing like like are you doing one at a time or can the intern just kind of sign up and just like okay here's the link and it looks a little like Airbnb I guess. Exactly yeah so the employer inputs in the interns all their information and from that it automatically triggers an email that's sent to the student that says hey your employer is paying for this service go ahead and sign up and. And once they sign up, they fill out a survey, they tell us their interests, if they sleep in or stay up late, things like that, and then we automatically match them with housing that's specific, so maybe they like partying, or maybe they like a really quiet place. So we'll match them in the neighborhood along with the roommates who also fit their needs. What is the match exactly? Are these apartments that are Airbnb already? Are they, what's the quality level like? So they're Pad Piper specific, so they're owned by singular landlords versus property management. So it's not like something like Zeus or Bungalow where they're designed by us, but they're people's homes. They're pretty nice. Most of them do our private bedrooms versus two to three people in a bedroom. So you have exclusive access to this? Oh, interesting. How many rooms do you have access to? So right now we have about 250 beds just in San Francisco. And are these people, they decide not to go into zoos, like the landlords that are the owners? Yeah,'s funny how you ask that I mean that took a ton of initial research to kind of determine that but it really is because the interns are coming to these companies like if you can get a job at Google or Facebook it's filtered you have some yeah some means of responsibility and you're going to pay your rent on time. And usually the companies are also paying the rent for you. So that rent is kind of guaranteed to the landlords. Okay, can we go back? Because maybe I forgot already. The size of market question. How many, and I think it may be really big, is how many homes do you think you can, or sorry, how many beds do you think you can match in the summer? And if you did all of the U.S. So it would be beyond the summer, but the total market for interns year-round is 12 million just in the U.S. Total million number of interns? Mm-hmm. Okay. And then your take is $300 per intern, $360 per intern. Mm-hmm. That's a pretty big market just for interns. Yeah, there's actually 42 million worldwide too, which obviously we'd like to expand to eventually, but not quite yet. But I think the really awesome thing here is the supply side that wants to work exclusively with you. Totally, and I think that's the challenge too is that, well, the supply and the demand is definitely tough because there are so many students that it's tough to kind of balance that and getting the right number of landlords as well. What's your biggest obstacle right now? Probably getting landlords on board. So I think there's sort of this, all landlords have a very set process of doing things, especially landlords that own, you know, 1 to 15 properties who are the ones we're targeting. And so they're kind of unwilling to try new things. But once they do try Pad Piper, they absolutely love it. But it's overcoming that initial hump of trying a new service and making sure that it seems trustworthy to them. Where are they renting out to during the other times, like when it's not summer. So again, the internships or cooperative education are year round so they actually don't have any vacancies. So are most of your landlords non-Airbnb homeowners and like apartment buildings where people are at? Are those your kind of landlords? They're similar to Airbnb like homes. Homes, okay. Sorry, where did you find the 250 homes today? How did you find them? Really through word of mouth, which was great. But, yeah, in the initial days, it had just kind of spread. And especially student referrals, too. If a student lived there and then someone's coming in the next term, they just, you know, pass off the link and say, you know, this place was great and you should stay there. the link and say, you know, this place was great and you should stay there. So if I'm understanding this correctly, are you constrained by supply right now? And you're focused on the Bay Area? Anybody in the audience have a home? $300, $600 a month. Look at that. I found you six people right there in the audience. Seven, okay. I went to the audience. Seven, okay. Audience Member 1 Audience Member 2 Audience Member 3 Audience Member 4 Audience Member 5 Audience Member 6 Audience Member 7 Audience Member 8 Audience Member 9 Audience Member 10 Audience Member 11 Audience Member 12 Audience Member 13 their tenant and laws and so what you have to offer is far better than an Airbnb because I don't have to deal with the transient piece of it and they're somewhat more you know filtered and secondly this is a way for landlords to actually overcome the Airbnb restrictions that San Francisco has placed on them and actually get full rent and a higher rent because as having been a landlord I was restricted there I didn't rent out my place for years because I didn't want people in there because you cannot get them out and so I actually think that if you would advertise to the real estate lawyers, Bornstein is an example of one. There's three or four top ones in San Francisco. You would have people running to your door. Have you tried that? No, but I will tonight. Yeah, that'd be great. Thanks. Okay, we have a couple minutes. So it sounds like you have a supply-side problem. There's options. It does sound like you just need to talk to more people because once they... It's like I can get someone highly filtered to rent a home. Lots of people have space, and they don't want to maybe even do the Airbnb thing because they have to go through that whole process. But you have a highly controlled process. So you just need to create that type of funnel. And I think too with the employer program, we did a ton of initial research and user testing. That's actually how we got our paid pilot is that we would just user test a prototype that was by no means developed and they were like oh can we do that this fall we're like sure definitely we're it's it's totally built oh and the employees at Facebook could be your supply too as well right yeah there's just totally so much access to so many people with homes that's true I mean do they ever end up up, is it like, you know, when they had a student abroad and then they live into your house? Like, is that where it's turning out to be, where they host, I guess the employees host the interns? It totally could be that. I mean, yeah, the landlord could live in the same space. They could live in another space. But, yeah, either works. either works. It's really great idea. Good luck. I think we're out of time. Thank you. All right. I think next up is Nifty. Come on up. Why don't we welcome her. I'm Tiffany. Tiffany. Why don't you tell us about, well, why don't you tell us your name and a bit about Nifty. Yeah, so I'm Tiffany. I'm a technical co-founder of Nifty. And Nifty is a Chrome extension that helps software engineers and their teams work better by organizing their data across all of their productivity apps. What we do is actually surface the data at the right place just at the right time. And so my co-finder and I found each other at work as software engineers and this was actually a tool we were looking for to solve our immediate problem of our engineering team. As an engineering lead, one thing we noticed was there's a lot of workplace inefficiency about how we were developing and especially when we were triaging problems because of how we stored data across all these apps. So for an individual to build and create a feature, I'm using seven to ten different applications to do the job. And I want to keep that going because certain tools are good for certain things. But what happens is there's a lot of... Sorry, can I stop you there? Because can you give a very specific example of what your tool does, the Chrome extension does? Yeah, so what we do is let's say I'm using Confluence, and that has documentation of what I need to build. And then my product manager creates a Jira ticket to give me more product descriptions. My designer slacks me a link to Zeppelin. I personally like to use GitHub for both PRs and then also writing notes. And then my programmer next to me, and we pair program, he's using Evernote because that's his favorite tools. Now, to access the data I need to build the tool, not only do I have to leave GitHub where I'm working, I have to go to Confluence, check the documentation there. Then I have to go to Slack, click a link to go to Zeppelin and try to read the specs and come back to GitHub. At the same time, I have to talk to my programmer next to me in person or on Evernote to figure out what they're working on and how I can make the feature better. That whole cycle happens, so I lose time, but also people are making updates, and that update's not getting to me real time. So now I have to have my internal manual way of checking all of these places to make sure I don't miss something. And it's something that sounds trivial, but it slows engineering teams down quite a bit. And then also a lot of mistakes are made as we build. So how does your Chrome extension work in this? of mistakes are made as we build. So how does your Chrome extension work in this? I downloaded your Chrome extension. Is it like a tab? Yeah. So it's a toolbar that is going to make relationships and surface data based on the key terms and headings that I have. So if I'm on GitHub and I'm making something that's called Slack integration feature, it's going to scrape my data, the data of my entire team, and surface it to me. It's going to scrape my data, the data of my entire team, and surface it to me. It's going to go scrape slack of the data team and it's just going to surface it in some sidebar? Yeah, so in a sidebar that I can customize. So I can customize the view, the presentation. Depending on how people like to work, we have different animations that kind of update you and notify you. It also will show the relationship between me and the other people on my team in real time. You guys haven't launched, correct? That's right. So we're launching within two weeks on the 25th. So we're pre-launched right now. Okay. Why haven't you launched sooner? So we start, we were actually in startup school, which has been amazing. And we got critical feedback from our advisor. We started off with this really big platform. It was super ambitious. And I know some people, they talked about wanting a technical co-founder, where the flip side of that is having two technical co-founders that just want to code and like, you know, the messaging is like, we'll figure it out. And it's like, no, we have to work on that and then also scope. So the feedback we got, which was to narrow what we were doing and ship as quickly as we could. So we fully focused on this Chrome extension tool that we think engineers will love, because engineers love to have things that save them time and that are efficient. So that's our plan now. OK, and so the tool that you're going to launch with is going to have what feature in it? So it'll have the feature to both navigate between all of your tabs within Chrome and receive updates and data integration with the rest of your team. Just like alerts? Yes. Okay, alerts and easy navigation. Right. How much time do you think engineers waste doing all of this stuff? I imagine a lot, but what percentage do you imagine? So we think conservatively it's 15 to 20%. It could be higher. And that's from our team and personal experience and then like engineers we've talked to in the community. It could be quite a bit. And so there's wasted time as far as like going to different destinations. But there's also that context switching, which is a lot of research around the fact that like I'm working on something and now I've left and I've looked at five different places. It's kind of stopped my workflow and I'm also kind of struggling to get back into programming mode at that point. So what you're saying at companies, 20% of every engineer's time is wasted on not coding. On useless tasks, essentially, that can be solved through the tool. Right. I mean, it's kind of like saying one out of five engineers is doing nothing. Right. Trying to create a sales pitch here. Right. Yeah. So I think that's what we want to do. I think there's kind of the looking at the question of there's not enough engineers, but we want to look at the engineers that we do have. How do we keep them productive and then also let them work on the things they want. I know the engineers I know and from my team getting pulled out to do administrative tasks or to kind of look at the stuff is something that's very frustrating. Where did you get this idea from? Like are there typically when there's something in which engineers are wasting a ton of time on at huge companies like Facebook or Google they'll have built internal tools to solve it. Has that actually been built in these big companies? So that's what we're, we still are trying to figure out if it's proprietary tools, because a lot of the big companies have internal tooling and they have teams dedicated to that. From what we understand, I mean, you have something like Asana that was built in Facebook and then went public. So we know that there's productivity tools built around, but they're not kind of a Chrome extension that lets you stay focused in your window. There's also companies that are dealing with kind of, we're going to take all your data and we're going to build this mega app. And you're going to use this one app and then you don't have to worry about these different destinations. So people have kind of confirmed the problem and they have slightly different approaches. We haven't seen one that's doing kind of what we are, which is more of an ambient data scraping and presentation. Got it. I would, my feedback, quick feedback for you when you launch is to state exactly what you do, which is different from what you started with when you were describing, because you were describing kind of a vision in the beginning, which is great. But I think you'll see when you launch, people are not gonna grasp on that. They're gonna grasp on like, I wanna help you switch tabs much more efficiently which actually if you have if you're one of those people like 60 tabs open like myself like that's great and then also unification of all the alerts and stuff like that at the right time that you want to see cool what's the biggest challenge that you're having so it's actually what you just hit on is messaging so I think that's been our learning curve. We're super excited to kind of learn the marketing and growth part and really excited to get there quickly. I think talking about it in a clear way and then like people knowing what they're downloading and using it for, that's been our biggest challenge. But this is helpful to like repeating it over and over again and getting feedback. And also the blank stares when people are like I didn't understand what you're saying. Cool yeah it's I mean in two weeks good luck with your launch everyone download what is it? So it's getnifty.io yeah you can sign up for the beta now and then we will send it to you. All right good luck. Thank you. I wanted to thank the two founders that came up here from Nifty and Pad Piper. They were both from the audience. So this is thank you to you both. And I wanted to thank you guys all for spending a Saturday here with us. It's been awesome to meet you all. And we have a reception across the street starting now. And so we hope to spend the next couple hours with you as well. And you have an opportunity to get to know more founders like the ones that you saw on stage today. And so a few quick thank yous. And one thing actually first is we have a bunch of deals that are available to everyone who is here today. We'll be sending out an email with all of that information. But we have AWS, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean credits that are available to you. Clerky and Stripe Atlas also have deals. So keep an eye out for our email. Thank you to the YC team who put this all together, especially Dom who heads up events. We have Adele in the back who's been running all the slides. We have Sharon and then all the women who are up here on stage, all the partners, and we will all be across the street. So please come say hi to all of us. And we'd love to stay in touch with you. And so we're all, if you haven't heard of it yet, there's Leap. It's an online community where women can talk about whatever they want, women in tech. There's a lot of founders. There's a lot of engineers. It's really cool to see. I think there's a bunch. How many of you are already on Leap? Oh, awesome. Okay. And so for the rest of you, it's leap.whitecombinator.com. Come meet us online there. And so one last thing is that there are bathrooms across the street. There's like the additional restroom set up in the parking lot and there's some outside as well. So we will see you across the street at the cocktail hour. Nice to meet you all and thank you so much for spending this afternoon with us. Adele. Thank you. Okay, go. Thank you. you you you
